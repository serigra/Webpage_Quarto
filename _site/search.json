    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nRobotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) gained much popularity during the last decade. Although the influence of intraoperative fluid management on patients’ outcome has been largely discussed in general, its impact on perioperative complications and length of hospitalization in patients undergoing RALP has not been examined so far. We hypothesized that a more restrictive fluid management might lead to a shortened length of hospitalization and a decreased rate of complications in our patients.\nMethods\nRetrospective analysis of data of 182 patients undergoing RALP at an University Hospital (first series of RALP performed at the center).\nResults\nThe amount of fluid administered was initially normalized for body mass index of the patient and the duration of the operation and additionally corrected for age and the interaction of these variables. The application of crystalloids (multiple linear regression model, estimate = -0.044, p = 0.734) had no effect on the length of hospitalization, whereas a negative effect was found for colloids (estimate = -8.317, p = 0.021). Additionally, a significant interaction term between age and the amount of colloid applied (estimate = 0.129, p = 0.028) was calculated. Evaluation of the influence of intraoperative fluid administration using multiple logistic regression models corrected for body mass index, duration of the surgery and additionally for age revealed a negative effect of crystalloids on the incidence of an anastomotic leak between bladder and urethra (estimate = -23.860, p = 0.017), with a significant interaction term between age and the amount of crystalloids (estimate = 0.396, p = 0.0134). Colloids had no significant effect on this particular complication (estimate = 1.887, p = 0.524). Intraoperative blood loss did not alter the incidence of an anastomotic leak (estimate = 0.001, p = 0.086), nor did it affect the length of hospitalization (estimate = 0.0001, p = 0.351).\nConclusions\nIn accordance to the findings of our study, we suggest that a standardized, more restrictive fluid management might be beneficial in patients undergoing RALP. In older patients this measure would be able to shorten the length of hospitalization and to decrease the incidence of anastomosis leakage as a major complication."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn a recent randomized controlled trial our group has demonstrated in 102 patients that late post-conditioning with sevoflurane performed in the intensive care unit after surgery involving extracorporeal circulation reduced damage to cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemia reperfusion injury. On the first post-operative day the sevoflurane patients presented with lower troponin T values when compared with those undergoing propofol sedation. In order to assess possible clinical relevant long-term implications in patients enrolled in this study, we performed the current retrospective analysis focusing on cardiac and non-cardiac events during the first 6 months after surgery.\nMethods\nAll patients who had successfully completed the late post-conditioning trial were included into this follow-up. Our primary and secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients experiencing cardiac and non-cardiac events, respectively. Additionally, we were interested in assessing therapeutic interventions such as initiation or change of drug therapy, interventional treatment or surgery.\nResults\nOf 102 patients analyzed in the primary study 94 could be included in this follow-up. In the sevoflurane group (with 41 patients) 16 (39%) experienced one or several cardiac events within 6 months after cardiac surgery, in the propofol group (with 53 patients) 19 (36%, p=0.75). Four patients (9%) with sevoflurane vs. 7 (13%) with propofol sedation had non-cardiac events (p=0.61). While a similar percentage of patients suffered from cardiac and/or non-cardiac events, only 12 patients in the sevoflurane group compared to 20 propofol patients needed a therapeutic intervention (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.04-1.43, p=0.12). A similar result was found for hospital admissions: 2 patients in the sevoflurane group had to be re-admitted to the hospital compared to 8 in the propofol group (OR 0.23, 95% CI: 0.04-1.29, p=0.10).\nConclusions\nSevoflurane does not seem to provide protection with regard to the occurrence of cardiac and non-cardiac events in the 6-month period following cardiac surgery with the use of extracorporeal circulation. However, there was a clear trend towards fewer interventions (less need for treatment, fewer hospital admissions) associated with sevoflurane post-conditioning in patients experiencing any event. Such results might encourage launching large multicenter post-conditioning trials with clinical outcome defined as primary endpoint."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Animal species that live in complex foraging niches have, in general, improved access to energy-rich and seasonally stable food sources. Because human food procurement is uniquely complex, we ask here which conditions may have allowed species to evolve into such complex foraging niches, and also how niche complexity is related to relative brain size. To do so, we divided niche complexity into a knowledge-learning and a motor-learning dimension. Using a sample of 78 primate and 65 carnivoran species, we found that two life-history features are consistently correlated with complex niches: slow, conservative development or provisioning of offspring over extended periods of time. Both act to buffer low energy yields during periods of learning, and may thus act as limiting factors for the evolution of complex niches. Our results further showed that the knowledge and motor dimensions of niche complexity were correlated with pace of development in primates only, and with the length of provisioning in only carnivorans. Accordingly, in primates, but not carnivorans, living in a complex foraging niche requires enhanced cognitive abilities, i.e., a large brain. The patterns in these two groups of mammals show that selection favors evolution into complex niches (in either the knowledge or motor dimension) in species that either develop more slowly or provision their young for an extended period of time. These findings help to explain how humans constructed by far the most complex niche: our ancestors managed to combine slow development (as in other primates) with systematic provisioning of immatures and even adults (as in carnivorans).

    "text": "Animal species that live in complex foraging niches have, in general, improved access to energy-rich and seasonally stable food sources. Because human food procurement is uniquely complex, we ask here which conditions may have allowed species to evolve into such complex foraging niches, and also how niche complexity is related to relative brain size. To do so, we divided niche complexity into a knowledge-learning and a motor-learning dimension. Using a sample of 78 primate and 65 carnivoran species, we found that two life-history features are consistently correlated with complex niches: slow, conservative development or provisioning of offspring over extended periods of time. Both act to buffer low energy yields during periods of learning, and may thus act as limiting factors for the evolution of complex niches. Our results further showed that the knowledge and motor dimensions of niche complexity were correlated with pace of development in primates only, and with the length of provisioning in only carnivorans. Accordingly, in primates, but not carnivorans, living in a complex foraging niche requires enhanced cognitive abilities, i.e., a large brain. The patterns in these two groups of mammals show that selection favors evolution into complex niches (in either the knowledge or motor dimension) in species that either develop more slowly or provision their young for an extended period of time. These findings help to explain how humans constructed by far the most complex niche: our ancestors managed to combine slow development (as in other primates) with systematic provisioning of immatures and even adults (as in carnivorans).

We first examined the determinants of an individual’s response-and-exploration style, which we assessed using five independent novelty response and exploration tasks. Our findings revealed that both previous care by humans and social housing with conspecifics elicited a curious response-and-exploration style (characterized by a positive response to novelty and a high motivation to explore). Second, we investigated how the response-and-exploration style and previous experiences affected an individual’s problem-solving performance in a variety of tasks aimed at assessing physical cognition, including reversal learning, inhibitory control, causal reasoning and tool use. We found curiosity to be the sole predictor of problem-solving performance. However, curiosity is strikingly rare in wild orang-utans, being mainly induced by contact with humans and living in a safe and stimulating physical and social environment. We therefore suggest that curiosity in orang-utans is an artefact of captivity, a potential only expressed under special conditions. The origin of curiosity in our own lineage may have been an important contributor to the rapid rise in the complexity of our ancestors’ material culture."

Analgesics were claimed in 34.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.9–35.0%) of pregnancies, most frequently paracetamol (30.3%, 29.8–30.8%), followed by NSAIDs (8.6%, 8.3–8.8%), and opioids (2.6%, 2.4–2.8%). NSAIDs were claimed in 1.3% (1.2–1.4%) of pregnancies after week 24, and opioids were claimed in 1.3% (1.2–1.4%) in trimester 3. Antibiotics were dispensed in 26.3% (25.8–26.8%) of pregnancies, most frequently amoxicillin (14.6%, 95% CI 14.2–14.9%). Claims for potentially teratogenic or fetotoxic antibiotics during risk periods were each recorded in &lt;0.6% of pregnancies. PPIs were claimed in 16.0% (15.6–16.3%) and antacids in 10.6% (10.3–11.0%) of pregnancies, but several antacid products are not reimbursed and thus not present in insurance claims. Anti-nausea drugs were claimed in 16.4% (16.0–16.7%) of pregnancies, most frequently metoclopramide in 14.4% (14.0–14.7%). Ondansetron was mainly dispensed in trimester 1, 1.0% (0.9–1.1%). In total, 6.4% (6.2–6.7%) of pregnancies had a claim for laxatives, most frequently for macrogol (2.4%, 95% CI 2.2–2.5%).\nConclusion\nThe observed pattern of claimed drugs during pregnancy is in line with existing treatment guidelines. Exposure to potentially teratogenic and fetotoxic drugs was small, but given the lack of recorded diagnosis, we cannot determine if their use was clinically indicated."

    "text": "Background\nEvidence on the use of drugs during pregnancy in Switzerland is lacking.\nObjectives\nTo evaluate utilisation of prescribed drugs during pregnancy in outpatient care in Switzerland, focusing on treatments for pain, infections, gastro-oesophageal reflux, nausea/vomiting, and constipation.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a descriptive study using the Swiss Helsana claims database (2014–2018). We established a cohort of pregnancies by identifying deliveries and estimating the date of the last menstrual period. We identified claims for the following drugs during pregnancy; analgesics (opioids, paracetamol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), oral antibiotics, antacids, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), anti-nausea drugs (propulsives and 5HT3-antagonists), and laxatives.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nMedical treatment quality has been shown to be better in high volume than in low volume hospitals. However, this relationship has not yet been confirmed in abdominal cancer in Switzerland and is relevant for referral of patients and healthcare planning. Thus, the present study investigates the association between hospital volumes for surgical resections of colon, gastric, rectal, and pancreatic carcinomas and outcomes.\nMethods\nThis retrospective analysis is based on anonymized claims data of patients with mandatory health insurance at Helsana Group, a leading health insurance in Switzerland. Outcome parameters were length of hospital stay, mortality and cost during the inpatient stay as well as at 1-year follow-up. Hospital volume information was derived from the Quality Indicators dataset provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. The impact of hospital volume on the different treatment outcomes was statistically tested using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, taking into account the non-independence of observations from the same hospital.\nResults\nThe studies included 2′859 resections in patients aged 18 years and older who were hospitalized for abdominal cancer surgery between 2014 and 2018. Colon resections were the most common procedures (n = 1′690), followed by rectal resections (n = 709). For rectal, colon and pancreatic resections, an increase in the mean number of interventions per hospital and a reduction of low volume hospitals could be observed. For the relationship between hospital volume and outcomes, we did not observe a clear dose-response relationship, as no significantly better outcomes were observed in the higher-volume category than in the lower-volume category. Even though a positive “routine effect” cannot be excluded, our results suggest that even hospitals with low volumes are able to achieve comparable treatment outcomes to larger hospitals.\nConclusions\nIn summary, this study increases transparency on the relationship between hospital volume and treatment success. It shows that simple measures such as defining a minimum number of procedures only might not lead to the intended effects if other factors such as infrastructure, the operating team or aggregation level of the available data are not taken into account."
