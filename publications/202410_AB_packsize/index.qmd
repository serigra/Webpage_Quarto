description: "This study assessed the potential mismatch between prescribed antibiotic pack sizes and guideline recommendations, using data from a large Swiss health insurance company. It found that 31.6% of prescriptions were potentially non-conform, with 2.7 million excess tablets overprescribed in 2022. The results highlight the need for alternatives, such as exact pill dispensing, to reduce antibiotic resistance and waste caused by inappropriate pack sizes.."
