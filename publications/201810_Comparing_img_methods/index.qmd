description: "This pilot study compared the effectiveness of PET-CT and contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) for detecting lung cancer recurrence during post-curative treatment surveillance. The results showed no significant difference between the two imaging methods in identifying cancer recurrence. Both methods demonstrated similar sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that CE-CT remains a reliable and cost-effective option for follow-up in lung cancer patients."

## Abstract

**Background**

Scientific data on the image modality to be used in postcurative treatment surveillance of non-small cell lung cancer patients are scarce. This prospective randomized pilot trial compared the performance of integrated 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT).

**Methods**

After termination of curative-intent treatment, patients were randomly assigned to the PET-CT or the CE-CT group. Imaging was performed every 6 months for 2 years. If suspicious radiologic findings were detected or patients became symptomatic, a diagnostic workup was initiated. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for detecting cancer recurrence were calculated for both imaging procedures.

**Results**

The study enrolled 96 patients. In 14 of 50 patients (28%) in the PET-CT group and in 14 of 46 patients (30%) in the CE-CT group, a suspicious radiologic finding was confirmed as cancer recurrence after diagnostic workup. False-positive findings were detected in 11 patients (22%) of the PET-CT group and in 8 patients (17%) of the CE-CT group. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for detecting cancer recurrence (95% confidence interval) were 0.88 (0.62 to 0.98), 0.62 (0.42 to 0.79), and 0.56 (0.35 to 0.76) for PET-CT and 0.93 (0.68 to 1.00), 0.72 (0.53 to 0.87), and 0.64 (0.41to 0.83) for CE-CT, respectively.

**Conclusions**

The results of our study suggest that PET-CT is not superior to CE-CT in detecting cancer recurrence during 2 years after curative-intent treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
