        "\n",
        "The workshop showed how easy it is to build your own R package and that it is *not* reserved for advanced developers; it can be done in just a few lines of code and can greatly simplify and streamline your daily R workflow - regardless of how many functions you have or how simple they are.\n",
        "Nicola gave a very hands-on workshop on building R packages covering the most important steps to build one from scratch, including writing functions, documenting them, adding tests, and sharing the package with others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Find the workshop slides [here](https://nrennie.rbind.io/r-pharma-2025-r-packages/#/title-slide) and a summary of the most important commands from the [{usethis}](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) and [{devtools}](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) package right below.\n",

        ":::::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n",
        "## Summary of Most Important Commands:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Build **package**\n",
        "  - `usethis::create_package(\"package_name\")`\n",
        "* edit **DESCRIPTION** file\n",
        "  - e.g. *Title*: title corresponds to a very short description of your package\n",
        "  - e.g. define a licence: `usethis::use_mit_license()` -> automatically updates your DESCRIPTION file\n",
        "* **Install** package\n",
        "  - `devtools::install()` or press *Install* in the \"Build\"-tab on top right (only appears in R-package project). So far the commands built the R package and installed and loaded it.\n",
        "* Add **functions**\n",
        "  - add a new R script and add your function \n",
        "  - use `devtools::load_all()` -> simulates installation, much quicker than installing the package -> use `load_all()` while developing your R package\n",
        "  - good-to-know: \n",
        "    - unfortunately one cannot use subfolders within the `/R` folder to organize functions, but one can have multiple functions in one script\n",
        "    - if a certain function is not available after running `devtools::install()`, the function has probably not been exported yet. It is recommended to use `devtools::load_all()` while developing a package.\n",
        "* Write **documentation**\n",
        "  - Use [{roxygen2}](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) package\n",
        "    - helps to write the NAMESPACE file\n",
        "    - add `#' @export` on top of function in your function script\n",
        "\t\t- use `devtools::document()` > updates NAMESPACE\n",
        "  - different roxygen tags\n",
        "    - `#' @export`: makes function available to users of the package\n",
        "    - `#' @param`: describes function argument\n",
        "    - `#' @returns`: explains what the function returns\n",
        "    - `#' @examples`: shows examples how to use the function\n",
        "  - rerun `devtools::document()` > it will add an .Rd file in your `/man` folder\n",
        "\t- rerun `devtools::load_all()` > check with `?my_function` to see whether the help file was updated!\n",
        "* **Tests**\n",
        "  - R CMD check: do functions run? Are they documented? > run *check* in the Build-Tab\n",
        "  - Linting checks: is the code well formatted?\n",
        "  - Unit tests: do functions work as they should?\n",
        "  - CRAN checks: does it work across different systems? Does it not break any other packages?\n",
        "  - In the workshop we only covered R CMD check. It is highly recommended to fix the warnings and errors.\n",
        "  - example error: missing namespacing of package > use `usethis::use_package(\"stringr\")` which will add in DESCRIPTION File. Namespacing (package::function) can be used to import, but you could also use roxygen2 with the tag `@importFrom stringr` -> has the same effect as namespacing!\n",
        "* **Share** packages with others\n",
        "  - add your package to CRAN\n",
        "  - install from local copy: `devtools::install_local(\"package_name\")`\n",
        "  - from GitHub: `devtools::install_github(\"username/package_name\")`\n",
