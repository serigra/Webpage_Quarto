I attended the [R/Medicine](https://rconsortium.github.io/RMedicine_website/) virtual conference for the first time this year ([2025](https://rconsortium.github.io/RMedicine_2025/)). The conference is focused on the use of R in healthcare and medical research, running since 2018, and it features a combination of hands-on workshops and presentations. Initiated by the [R Consortium](https://r-consortium.org/) and sponsored by Posit and Genentech, R/Medicine stands out for its accessibility — conference fees remain very affordable even for non-students. \
The following section highlights my favorite sessions, condensed to their key takeaways, and mainly serves as a repository for links to presentations and workshop materials.

## R Package Development with GitHub Pages and {pkgdown} · [Melissa Van Bussel, Statistics Canada]{style="color:#7F8A80;"}

:::::: columns

::: {.column width="68%"}

Besides the creation of a basic package, the workshop covered setting up a customized package website with [{`pkgdown`}](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) and GitHub Pages. Along the way, Melissa shared many useful tips and tricks using the [{`usethis`}](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package.

Find the slides of the workshop [here](https://melissavanbussel.github.io/rmedicine/slides.html#/title-slide) and the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/melissavanbussel/rmedicine/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).

My result of the pkgdown site: [serigra.github.io/rmedicine/](https://serigra.github.io/rmedicine/) (GitHub [repo](https://github.com/serigra/rmedicine)).

## Summary of Basic Commands:

* Setup
    - `usethis::git_sitrep()`: situation report / check GitHub configuration.
* Package Creation
    - file > new project > new directory > R package using devtools
    - `DESCRIPTION` file: `usethis::use_mit_license()`, change version number of something short
    - `usethis::use_readme_md()`: will open README.md, which will be the homepage of our pkgdown site
    - `usethis::use_r("my_function)`: will open an R file
    - `usethis::use_test("my_function")`: will open a test file
* Put up to GitHub Pages
    - `check()`: check if package is working
    - `usethis::use_git()` to initialize git
    - `usethis::use_github()`: creates repo on GitHub
    - `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`: creates pkgdown site and pushes to GitHub pages. Whenever push to main branch, website will be automatically updated.
    - `usethis::build_site()`: view pkgdown site locally
* Customization of Pkgdown Site
  - hex-logo: [hexmake](https://connect.thinkr.fr/hexmake/) Shiny app or [{`hexSticker`}](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) package
  - `usethis::use_logo("path_to_logo")`: adding logo in right location
  - `pkgdown::build_favicons()`: create favicons
  - ...many more customization tips in the slide deck.
* GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages
  - GitHub Pages will host any page that ends up in our `/docs` folder
  - `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml`: is automatically built by `usethis`. When push to main branch, the terminal commands in this file are run -> defines workflow pipeline.
* Important Difference
  - `_pkgdown.yml` vs. `pkgdown.yaml`: first controls how pkgdown site looks like, second is for GitHub actions.

Writing dataviz code that your future self will thank you for!\
I often find myself spending a lot of time fine-tuning visualizations to make them visually appealing - reusing similar code again and again, not only for publications but also for quick, ad-hoc analyses. These are what Cara Thompson calls those "can you just?" moments. In her workshop, Cara clearly illustrated why and how to parameterise plots — so our future selves can spend less time tweaking and more time thinking.\

A couple of really cool tools and tricks I learned for making plots smarter and faster:\

* Choose and blend colors using her [{monochromeR}](https://github.com/cararthompson/monochromeR) package and the corresponding [Shiny app](https://cararthompson.shinyapps.io/monochromeR/). For even more details on monochromeR, see her [website](https://www.cararthompson.com/shinyapps/2022-01-11-monochromer/monochromer#i-also-turned-it-onto-a-shinyapp-so-you-can-use-the-no-code-solution-which-also-has-a-bit-of-extra-flexibility-just-here).\
* In {ggplot2} use the `base_size` argument in combination with `rel()` to set relative sizes of text elements. *Example*: `theme_minimal(base_size = 16)` and `element_text(size = rel(0.8))` for axis text.\
* Put {ggplot2} theme-definitions/ plots into **functions**! and use `get()` for getting e.g. grouping variable in a function. *Example*: `function(group_var = "species")` and inside the function `df |> group_by(group = get(group_var))`.\

## Ellmer - Demistifying LLMs · [Joe Cheng, CTO Posit]{style="color:#7F8A80;"}

\

Joe Cheng showcased the following three `R` packages designed to interface with large language models (LLMs), making it easy for developers to build interactive, AI-driven applications.\
In addition to the packages, he provided a concise yet insightful overview of how LLMs work, explaining the core concepts that are essential for anyone looking to use them effectively. Joe also introduced the concept of **Tool Calling** — a feature that enables LLMs to invoke external functions or tools to extend their capabilities (for example, retrieving real-time weather data).\
He compared the strengths of different LLM providers, noting that OpenAI’s models excel at general-purpose tasks and conversation, while Anthropic’s models tend to perform better in code generation. Finally, he shared practical tips for prompt engineering, showing how thoughtful prompt design can significantly improve model performance and output quality.\

[{ellmer}](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/).\
Check out the [*Getting started with ellmer*](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/articles/ellmer.html) section in the package documentation, which gives a nice overview on the core concepts and example use cases.

Jeremy Selva shared a comprehensive workflow for retrospective clinical data harmonization using R, demonstrating how to ensure data quality, consistency, and reproducibility across diverse datasets. He demonstrated practical strategies for standardising clinical data from diverse sources to improve the reliability of analyses, and showed how to create an automated technical report that transparently documents the data processing workflow — fostering clarity and traceability both for oneself and for collaborators in research projects.\

A few useful tools I discovered along the way:

* [Cleaning Medical Data with R](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/workshops/2023-06-06-cleaning-medical-data-with-r/) workshop by Shannon Pileggi (R/ Medicine 2023).

:::::: columns

* [`{vroom}`](https://vroom.r-lib.org/) package for fast data reading including the function `problems()` which retrieves a data frame with one row for each potential problem in your data.
