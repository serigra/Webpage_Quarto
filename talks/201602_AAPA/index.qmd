description: "The expensive brain hypothesis suggests that seasonal environments impose energetic limits on brain size evolution, while the cognitive buffering hypothesis suggests that larger-brained species are better able to adapt to seasonal challenges. In a study of 41 non-primate mammals, species with higher seasonality had smaller brain sizes, confirming the patterns seen in primates, but finding weak support for cognitive buffering. Overall, energetic constraints appear to play a key role in the evolution of brain size, with cognitive buffering appearing to be more pronounced in large-brained species, especially anthropoid primates."
