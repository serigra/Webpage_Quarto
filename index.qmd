::: {#hero-heading}
I am a data scientist and part of the health services research team of one of the biggest health insurance companies in Switzerland. By training, I am a biostatistician and biologist. My passion lies in R programming and expressing quantitative information using numbers, models and visual displays. This website serves as a documentation of various topics around statistics, visualizations and data science, which are certainly of interest to my later self, but possibly also to others.
