    "text": "Raw parameter estimates from complex models, particularly those involving non-linear terms or interactions, are often challenging to interpret and may lack real-world context. This difficulty is especially pronounced for non-statisticians, who are often the ones tasked with translating results into practical solutions. In this regard, marginal effects can be useful, as they provide a clearer and more interpretable view of the relationships within a statistical model.\nThe term “marginal effects” carries slightly different meanings across different fields and contexts. For an in-depth exploration of this terminology, I recommend to read Andrew Heiss’s blog post. For the following, I’ll adhere to the following general concept: Marginal effects illustrate how a one-unit change in the independent variable influences the dependent variable, while holding other factors or covariates constant. This concept manifests differently across model types:\nIn the following sections, I’ll explore two examples of how to enhance the interpretability of model outputs using marginal effects and the marginaleffects package.\nNote I: While researching marginal effects, I found two particularly insightful blog posts - one by an unnamed author from the University of Virginia and another by Andrew Heiss. Both offer comprehensive descriptions of the concept. However, in this post, I’ve attempted to articulate the idea behind marginal effects in my own words, hoping to provide a perspective that might be helpful to others, including my future self.\nNote II: There are several other excellent R packages for calculating marginal effects, such as margins and emmeans. However, for the sake of simplicity and consistency, I chose not to include them in this post."

    "text": "Unraveling Curved Relationships: Marginal Effects Between Continuous Variables\nWhen dealing with continuous variables for both predictors and outcomes, marginal effects become a powerful tool for interpretation of non-linear models like quadratic relationships, where raw regression estimates are challenging to interpret. Let’s explore this concept using the PimaIndiansDiabetes dataset, where we’ll examine the relationship between body mass and age. While this model is primarily for illustrative purposes and doesn’t seek deeper interpretation, it serves as a nice example of marginal effects in action.\n\n\n\n\nLinear vs. Quadratic: Which Fits Better?\nFirst, let’s compare a linear and a quadratic model to see which better describes the data:\n\n\nR Code\n# plot\nggplot(PimaIndiansDiabetes, aes(x = age, y = mass) ) +\n    geom_point( color = 'black', fill = '#7950f2', alpha = 0.6,  shape = 21, size = 3) +\n    stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x, linewidth = 1, color = '#1e1e1e') +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(20, 90, by=10)) +\n    labs(title = 'Linear Model',\n         x = \"Age\", y = \"Body Mass\")\n# linear model\nlinear_model &lt;- glm(mass ~ age, data = PimaIndiansDiabetes)\nsummary(linear_model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = mass ~ age, data = PimaIndiansDiabetes)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This suggests a more complex relationship between age and body mass: body mass tends to increase with age until around 45 years, after which it begins to decrease again.\n\n\n\nInterpreting Quadratic Relationships: The Power of Marginal Effects\nInterpreting the coefficients of a quadratic model can be challenging - so we have two coefficients age and I(age^2), one negative one positive - but how to interpret them? This is where marginal effects, specifically Marginal Effects at Representative Values (MER), come into play. We can calculate the slope (or tangent) at different ages to better understand the relationship, and these slopes are nothing else than marginal effects. Let’s calculate the marginal effects at ages 30 and 60 using the slopes() function from the marginaleffects package:\n\n\nslopes(quadratic_model, newdata = datagrid(age = c(30, 60))) -&gt; s; s\n\n\n Term age Estimate Std.

The slope is positive at age 30 but negative at age 60, indicating a shift in the relationship.\n\n\n\nComprehensive View: Marginal Effects Across All Ages\nTo get a complete picture, we can calculate and plot the marginal effects (slopes) for all ages using the plot_slopes() function:\n\n\n\nR Code\nplot_slopes(quadratic_model, variables = \"age\", condition = \"age\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = 'darkgrey', linetype = 'dotted', lwd = 1) +\n  geom_point(data = d.annot, aes(x = x, y = b), fill = 'darkorange', shape = 21, size = 4) +\n  geom_richtext(data = d.annot, aes(x = x, y = b, label = label), color = 'darkorange', nudge_y = 0.15) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(20, 90, by=10)) +\n  labs(title = 'Marginal Effects Across All Ages',\n       y = 'Marginal Effect (dy/dx)', x = 'Age')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe analysis reveals that:\n\nAt age 30, a one-year increase in age is associated with a 0.2 unit increase in body mass.\nAt age 60, a one-year increase in age is associated with a 0.4 unit decrease in body mass.\n\nThis shift from a positive to a negative relationship as age increases illustrates the non-linear nature of the association between age and body mass in the given dataset.\n\n\n\nBeyond MER: Exploring MEM and AME\nWe’ve just looked at the concept of Marginal Effects at Representative Values (MER). But there’s more! Two other concepts can shed light on the data (depending on context and data, one or the other make more sense): MEM and AME. Let’s break these three down in more detail:\n\n\n Marginal Effect at Representative Values (MER):\nThis represents the dy/dx at very specific, representative values of x (as for the age of 30 and 60 above).\n\n\nslopes(quadratic_model, newdata = datagrid(age = c(30, 60)))\n\n\n Term age Estimate Std.

    "text": "Unravelling Logistic Regression and Marginal Effects\nLogistic regression is a powerful and often used tool. The raw parameters represent log odds ratios, expressed as \\(log(\\frac{p}{1-p})\\). Exponentiating these coefficients results in odds ratios \\(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\), which is a common measure used in scientific studies. But what do these really mean in practical terms? The interpretation can be tricky, and it’s easy to conflate odds with probabilities. While it would be convenient if they were the same, they’re not – and this is where marginal effects shine.\nLet’s explore this concept using the PimaIndiansDiabetes dataset again. We’ll investigate how age and above-average body mass (binary coded) relate to the risk of diabetes. Again, this example is simplified for illustration, and is simply used to provide insights into marginal effects in case of a binary coded outcome variable.\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s prepare our data:\n\n# add binary predictor variable\nPimaIndiansDiabetes %&lt;&gt;% \n  mutate(diab = ifelse(diabetes == 'pos', 1, 0),\n         mass_fg = f_case_when(mass &lt;= mean(mass) ~ 'below-avg',\n                               mass &gt; mean(mass) ~ 'above-avg'))\n\n\n\n\nLets build the model:\n\n\nR Code\n# plot: age\np1 &lt;- ggplot(PimaIndiansDiabetes, aes(x = age, y = diab)) + \n  geom_point(fill = '#7950f2', alpha = 0.3,  shape = 21, size = 2) +\n  stat_smooth(method=\"glm\", color=\"black\", se=TRUE, method.args = list(family=binomial), linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = 'Logistic Regression - Age',\n       y = 'Probability of Diabetes', x = 'Age') +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 9),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 11))\n\n# plot: body mass binary coded\np2 &lt;- ggplot(PimaIndiansDiabetes, aes(x = mass_fg, y = diab)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, height = 0.05, fill = '#7950f2', alpha = 0.3,  shape = 21, size = 2) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", size = 3.5, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", method.args = list(family = \"binomial\"), se = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Body mass\", y = \"Probability of Diabetes\", title = \"Logistic Regression - Body Mass Flag\") +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 9),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 11))\n\np1+p2+plot_annotation(theme = theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill =\"#f8faf7\", color=\"#f8faf7\")))\n# logistic regression\nlogit_model &lt;- glm(diabetes ~ age + mass_fg, data = PimaIndiansDiabetes, family = 'binomial')\nsummary(logit_model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = diabetes ~ age + mass_fg, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = PimaIndiansDiabetes)\n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

Many people, including myself, find odds ratios difficult to grasp and often conflate them with probabilities.\nTherefore lets look at marginal effects, which offer a more accessible way to interpret our results. They show how changes in our predictors affect the probability (not odds!) of the outcome. First thing we could do, is to get individual risk differences: predict the probability of diabetes for a given subject based on their current age, and the probability for one year older (+1), and calculate the difference between the two. Analogously for the binary variable, predict the probability of diabetes for each subject, once treating the subject to be above average massed, and once below averaged massed, and take the difference thereof. We could do this by hand, but the comparisons() function from the marginaleffects does this for us (which is the analogue function to slopes() for the continuous relationship from above).\n\n\n\n\ncomparisons(logit_model, variable = 'age') -&gt; rr.age; rr.age\n\n\n Term Contrast Estimate Std.

This approach allows us to communicate complex statistical relationships in terms of probability changes, which are far more accessible to a general audience. Remember, while odds ratios have their place in statistical analysis, marginal effects offer a powerful tool for interpretation and communication in many real-world scenarios."

Guideline adherence was assessed by four evidence-based performance measures and four hierarchically constructed adherence levels. Generalized multilevel models were used to examine the effect of the incentive scheme on guideline adherence.\nResults\nA total of 6′273 patients with diabetes were included in this study. The raw descriptive statistics showed minor improvements in guideline adherence after the implementation. After adjusting for underlying patient characteristics and potential differences between physician networks, the likelihood of receiving a test was moderately but consistently higher after the implementation of the incentive scheme for most performance measures, ranging from18% (albuminuria: OR, 1.18; 95%-CI, 1.05–1.33) to 58% (HDL cholesterol: OR, 1.58; 95%-CI, 1.40–1.78). Full adherence was more likely after implementation of the incentive scheme (OR, 1.37; 95%-CI, 1.20–1.55), whereas level 1 significantly decreased (OR, 0.74; 95%-CI, 0.65 – 0.85).

Guideline adherence was assessed by four evidence-based performance measures and four hierarchically constructed adherence levels. Generalized multilevel models were used to examine the effect of the incentive scheme on guideline adherence.\nResults\nA total of 6′273 patients with diabetes were included in this study. The raw descriptive statistics showed minor improvements in guideline adherence after the implementation. After adjusting for underlying patient characteristics and potential differences between physician networks, the likelihood of receiving a test was moderately but consistently higher after the implementation of the incentive scheme for most performance measures, ranging from18% (albuminuria: OR, 1.18; 95%-CI, 1.05–1.33) to 58% (HDL cholesterol: OR, 1.58; 95%-CI, 1.40–1.78). Full adherence was more likely after implementation of the incentive scheme (OR, 1.37; 95%-CI, 1.20–1.55), whereas level 1 significantly decreased (OR, 0.74; 95%-CI, 0.65 – 0.85). The proportions of the other adherence levels were stable.\nConclusion\nIncentive schemes including transparency of the achieved performance may be able to improve guide-line adherence in patients with diabetes and are promising to increase quality of care in this patient population"

    "text": "Large brains support numerous cognitive adaptations and therefore may appear to be highly beneficial. Nonetheless, the high energetic costs of brain tissue may have prevented the evolution of large brains in many species. This problem may also have a developmental dimension: juveniles, with their immature and therefore poorly performing brains, would face a major energetic hurdle if they were to pay for the construction of their own brain, especially in larger-brained species. Here, we explore the possible role of parental provisioning for the development and evolution of adult brain size in birds. A comparative analysis of 1,176 bird species shows that various measures of parental provisioning (precocial vs. altricial state at hatching, relative egg mass, time spent provisioning the young) strongly predict relative brain size across species. The parental provisioning hypothesis also provides an explanation for the well-documented but so far unexplained pattern that altricial birds have larger brains than precocial ones. We therefore conclude that the evolution of parental provisioning allowed species to overcome the seemingly insurmountable energetic constraint on growing large brains, which in turn enabled bird species to increase survival and population stability. Because including adult eco- and socio-cognitive predictors only marginally improved the explanatory value of our models, these findings also suggest that the traditionally assessed cognitive abilities largely support successful parental provisioning. Our results therefore indicate that the cognitive adaptations underlying successful parental provisioning also provide the behavioral flexibility facilitating reproductive success and survival."

    "text": "Objectives\nThe olfactory function highly impacts quality of life (QoL). Continuous positive airway pressure is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is often applied by nasal masks (nCPAP). The influence of nCPAP on the olfactory performance of OSA patients is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the sense of smell before initiation of nCPAP and after three months treatment, in moderate and severe OSA patients.\nMethods\nThe sense of smell was assessed in 35 patients suffering from daytime sleepiness and moderate to severe OSA (apnea/hypopnea index ≥ 15/h), with the aid of a validated test battery (Sniffin’ Sticks) before initiation of nCPAP therapy and after three months of treatment. Additionally, adherent subjects were included in a double-blind randomized three weeks CPAP-withdrawal trial (sub-therapeutic CPAP pressure).\nResults\nTwenty five of the 35 patients used the nCPAP therapy for more than four hours per night, and for more than 70% of nights (adherent group). The olfactory performance of these patients improved significantly (p = 0.007) after three months of nCPAP therapy. When considering the entire group of patients, olfaction also improved significantly (p = 0.001). In the randomized phase the sense of smell of six patients deteriorated under sub-therapeutic CPAP pressure (p = 0.046) whereas five patients in the maintenance CPAP group showed no significant difference (p = 0.501).\nConclusions\nOlfactory performance improved significantly after three months of nCPAP therapy in patients suffering from moderate and severe OSA. It seems that this effect of nCPAP is reversible under sub-therapeutic CPAP pressure."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Objectives\nThe olfactory function highly impacts quality of life (QoL). Continuous positive airway pressure is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is often applied by nasal masks (nCPAP). The influence of nCPAP on the olfactory performance of OSA patients is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the sense of smell before initiation of nCPAP and after three months treatment, in moderate and severe OSA patients.\nMethods\nThe sense of smell was assessed in 35 patients suffering from daytime sleepiness and moderate to severe OSA (apnea/hypopnea index ≥ 15/h), with the aid of a validated test battery (Sniffin’ Sticks) before initiation of nCPAP therapy and after three months of treatment. Additionally, adherent subjects were included in a double-blind randomized three weeks CPAP-withdrawal trial (sub-therapeutic CPAP pressure).\nResults\nTwenty five of the 35 patients used the nCPAP therapy for more than four hours per night, and for more than 70% of nights (adherent group). The olfactory performance of these patients improved significantly (p = 0.007) after three months of nCPAP therapy. When considering the entire group of patients, olfaction also improved significantly (p = 0.001). In the randomized phase the sense of smell of six patients deteriorated under sub-therapeutic CPAP pressure (p = 0.046) whereas five patients in the maintenance CPAP group showed no significant difference (p = 0.501).\nConclusions\nOlfactory performance improved significantly after three months of nCPAP therapy in patients suffering from moderate and severe OSA. It seems that this effect of nCPAP is reversible under sub-therapeutic CPAP pressure."

    "text": "Animal species that live in complex foraging niches have, in general, improved access to energy-rich and seasonally stable food sources. Because human food procurement is uniquely complex, we ask here which conditions may have allowed species to evolve into such complex foraging niches, and also how niche complexity is related to relative brain size. To do so, we divided niche complexity into a knowledge-learning and a motor-learning dimension. Using a sample of 78 primate and 65 carnivoran species, we found that two life-history features are consistently correlated with complex niches: slow, conservative development or provisioning of offspring over extended periods of time. Both act to buffer low energy yields during periods of learning, and may thus act as limiting factors for the evolution of complex niches. Our results further showed that the knowledge and motor dimensions of niche complexity were correlated with pace of development in primates only, and with the length of provisioning in only carnivorans. Accordingly, in primates, but not carnivorans, living in a complex foraging niche requires enhanced cognitive abilities, i.e., a large brain. The patterns in these two groups of mammals show that selection favors evolution into complex niches (in either the knowledge or motor dimension) in species that either develop more slowly or provision their young for an extended period of time. These findings help to explain how humans constructed by far the most complex niche: our ancestors managed to combine slow development (as in other primates) with systematic provisioning of immatures and even adults (as in carnivorans). This study also provides strong support for the importance of ecological factors in brain size evolution."

We learned about different forms of disclosure (re-identification), the risk-utility trade-off, and the different disclosure methods. These methods correspond basically to two approaches:\n\nAltering original data using non-perturbative or perturbative masking.\nGenerating synthetic data based on models trained on real world data.\n\nConsidering approach (1), we learned about the functionalities of the sdcMicro package by Matthias Templ and colleagues. It allows you not only to actually anonymise data sets, but in addition offers tools to calculate global as well as individual risk propabilities of subjects being re-identifiable. This allows you to monitor and compare the “degree of anonymization”, which might be especially helpful for establishing a structured and streamlined process in the context of making sensitive data publicly available to others.\nMain take home message for myself are that there is more to data anonymization than altering/ aggregating/ suppression the original data, but that one should also think of synthesizing data sets."

    "text": "Background\nRobotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) gained much popularity during the last decade. Although the influence of intraoperative fluid management on patients’ outcome has been largely discussed in general, its impact on perioperative complications and length of hospitalization in patients undergoing RALP has not been examined so far. We hypothesized that a more restrictive fluid management might lead to a shortened length of hospitalization and a decreased rate of complications in our patients.\nMethods\nRetrospective analysis of data of 182 patients undergoing RALP at an University Hospital (first series of RALP performed at the center).\nResults\nThe amount of fluid administered was initially normalized for body mass index of the patient and the duration of the operation and additionally corrected for age and the interaction of these variables. The application of crystalloids (multiple linear regression model, estimate = -0.044, p = 0.734) had no effect on the length of hospitalization, whereas a negative effect was found for colloids (estimate = -8.317, p = 0.021). Additionally, a significant interaction term between age and the amount of colloid applied (estimate = 0.129, p = 0.028) was calculated. Evaluation of the influence of intraoperative fluid administration using multiple logistic regression models corrected for body mass index, duration of the surgery and additionally for age revealed a negative effect of crystalloids on the incidence of an anastomotic leak between bladder and urethra (estimate = -23.860, p = 0.017), with a significant interaction term between age and the amount of crystalloids (estimate = 0.396, p = 0.0134). Colloids had no significant effect on this particular complication (estimate = 1.887, p = 0.524). Intraoperative blood loss did not alter the incidence of an anastomotic leak (estimate = 0.001, p = 0.086), nor did it affect the length of hospitalization (estimate = 0.0001, p = 0.351).\nConclusions\nIn accordance to the findings of our study, we suggest that a standardized, more restrictive fluid management might be beneficial in patients undergoing RALP. In older patients this measure would be able to shorten the length of hospitalization and to decrease the incidence of anastomosis leakage as a major complication."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn a recent randomized controlled trial our group has demonstrated in 102 patients that late post-conditioning with sevoflurane performed in the intensive care unit after surgery involving extracorporeal circulation reduced damage to cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemia reperfusion injury. On the first post-operative day the sevoflurane patients presented with lower troponin T values when compared with those undergoing propofol sedation. In order to assess possible clinical relevant long-term implications in patients enrolled in this study, we performed the current retrospective analysis focusing on cardiac and non-cardiac events during the first 6 months after surgery.\nMethods\nAll patients who had successfully completed the late post-conditioning trial were included into this follow-up. Our primary and secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients experiencing cardiac and non-cardiac events, respectively. Additionally, we were interested in assessing therapeutic interventions such as initiation or change of drug therapy, interventional treatment or surgery.\nResults\nOf 102 patients analyzed in the primary study 94 could be included in this follow-up. In the sevoflurane group (with 41 patients) 16 (39%) experienced one or several cardiac events within 6 months after cardiac surgery, in the propofol group (with 53 patients) 19 (36%, p=0.75). Four patients (9%) with sevoflurane vs. 7 (13%) with propofol sedation had non-cardiac events (p=0.61). While a similar percentage of patients suffered from cardiac and/or non-cardiac events, only 12 patients in the sevoflurane group compared to 20 propofol patients needed a therapeutic intervention (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.04-1.43, p=0.12). A similar result was found for hospital admissions: 2 patients in the sevoflurane group had to be re-admitted to the hospital compared to 8 in the propofol group (OR 0.23, 95% CI: 0.04-1.29, p=0.10).\nConclusions\nSevoflurane does not seem to provide protection with regard to the occurrence of cardiac and non-cardiac events in the 6-month period following cardiac surgery with the use of extracorporeal circulation. However, there was a clear trend towards fewer interventions (less need for treatment, fewer hospital admissions) associated with sevoflurane post-conditioning in patients experiencing any event. Such results might encourage launching large multicenter post-conditioning trials with clinical outcome defined as primary endpoint."

We first examined the determinants of an individual’s response-and-exploration style, which we assessed using five independent novelty response and exploration tasks. Our findings revealed that both previous care by humans and social housing with conspecifics elicited a curious response-and-exploration style (characterized by a positive response to novelty and a high motivation to explore). Second, we investigated how the response-and-exploration style and previous experiences affected an individual’s problem-solving performance in a variety of tasks aimed at assessing physical cognition, including reversal learning, inhibitory control, causal reasoning and tool use. We found curiosity to be the sole predictor of problem-solving performance. However, curiosity is strikingly rare in wild orang-utans, being mainly induced by contact with humans and living in a safe and stimulating physical and social environment. We therefore suggest that curiosity in orang-utans is an artefact of captivity, a potential only expressed under special conditions.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Across the animal kingdom, we see remarkable variation in brain size. This variation has even increased over evolutionary time. Traditionally, studies aiming to explain brain size evolution have looked at the fitness benefits of increased brain size in relation to its increased cognitive performance in the social and/or ecological domain. However, brains are among the most energetically expensive tissues in the body and also require an uninterrupted energy supply. If not compensated, these energetic demands inevitably lead to a reduction in energy allocation to other vital functions. In this review, we summarize how an increasing number of studies show that to fully comprehend brain size evolution and the large variation in brain size across lineages, it is important to look at the economics of brains, including the different pathways through which the high energetic costs of brains can be offset. We further show how numerous studies converge on the conclusion that cognitive abilities can only drive brain size evolution in vertebrate lineages where they result in an improved energy balance through favourable ecological preconditions. Cognitive benefits that do not directly improve the organism’s energy balance can only be selectively favoured when they produce such large improvements in reproduction or survival that they outweigh the negative energetic effects of the large brain."

    "text": "Across the animal kingdom, we see remarkable variation in brain size. This variation has even increased over evolutionary time. Traditionally, studies aiming to explain brain size evolution have looked at the fitness benefits of increased brain size in relation to its increased cognitive performance in the social and/or ecological domain. However, brains are among the most energetically expensive tissues in the body and also require an uninterrupted energy supply. If not compensated, these energetic demands inevitably lead to a reduction in energy allocation to other vital functions. In this review, we summarize how an increasing number of studies show that to fully comprehend brain size evolution and the large variation in brain size across lineages, it is important to look at the economics of brains, including the different pathways through which the high energetic costs of brains can be offset. We further show how numerous studies converge on the conclusion that cognitive abilities can only drive brain size evolution in vertebrate lineages where they result in an improved energy balance through favourable ecological preconditions. Cognitive benefits that do not directly improve the organism’s energy balance can only be selectively favoured when they produce such large improvements in reproduction or survival that they outweigh the negative energetic effects of the large brain."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We aimed to evaluate the utilisation of all prescribed drugs during pregnancy dispensed in outpatient care in Switzerland between 2015 and 2021.\n\n\n\nWe conducted a descriptive study using the Swiss Helsana claims database (2015-2021). We established a cohort of pregnancies by identifying deliveries and estimating the date of the last menstrual period. We analysed the drug burden during a 270-day pre-pregnancy period, during pregnancy (overall and by trimester), and during a 270-day postpartum period. Subsequently, we quantified 1) the median number of drug dispensations (total vs. unique drug claims); and 2) the prevalence of exposure to at least one dispensed drug and the number of dispensed drugs (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥5); and 3) the 15 most frequently dispensed drugs were identified during each period, overall and stratified by maternal age.\n\n\n\nAmong 34,584 pregnant women (5.6% of all successful pregnancies in Switzerland), 87.5% claimed at least one drug (not including vitamins, supplements, and vaccines), and 33.3% claimed at least five drugs during pregnancy. During trimester 1 alone, 8.2% of women claimed at least five distinct drugs. The proportion of women who claimed prescribed drugs was lower pre-pregnancy (69.1%) and similar postpartum (85.6%) when compared to during pregnancy (87.5%). The most frequently claimed drugs during pregnancy were meaningfully different during pregnancy than before and after.\n\n\n\nThis study suggests that 8 of 10 women in Switzerland are exposed to prescribed drugs during pregnancy. Most drugs dispensed during pregnancy are comparatively well investigated and are considered safe. However, the high drug burden in this vulnerable patient population underlines the importance of evidence on the benefit-risk profile of individual drugs taken during pregnancy."

    "text": "Integrated care models (ICMs) might be an effective strategy to improve patients’ quality of care. The aim of this study was to compare different ICMs such as family-doctor models, and a standard care model (SCM) regarding patients’ drug safety in Swiss primary care.\n\n\n\nWe performed an observational study using health insurance claims data from patients who were continuously enrolled in an ICM or in a SCM between 2020 and 2021. ICMs included family-doctor model (FDM), family-doctor model light (FDM-light) and the telemedicine model (TM). Drug safety was assessed by the prescription of potentially inappropriate proton pump-inhibitors (PIPPI), opioids (PIO), medications (PIM), and polypharmacy. Propensity-score-weighted multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between different types of ICMs and drug safety.\n\n\n\nPatients in FDM had significantly lower odds of receiving PIPPI (OR, 0.86; CI 95%, 0.83–0.89), PIO (OR, 0.81; CI 95%, 0.76–0.85), PIM (OR, 0.94; CI 95%, 0.91–0.97), and polypharmacy (OR, 0.94; CI 95%, 0.91–0.97) compared to patients in SCM. Potentially inappropriate prescribing was also lower in patients in TM and partly in FDM-light than in SCM. Persons enrolled in FDM were less likely to receive PIM (OR, 0.93; CI 95%, 0.89–0.97) and polypharmacy (OR, 0.94; CI 95%, 0.90–0.99) than those in FDM-light, whereas the odds of receiving PIPPI and polypharmacy were higher in FDM than in TM.\n\n\n\nICMs were significantly associated with higher drug safety compared to SCM for most outcomes. Findings suggest that patients may benefit most from ICMs with a high degree of coordination or gatekeeping. ICM may represent an effective approach to improve patients’ drug safety and, thus, to reduce the risk of adverse events."

With ca 66% in 2022, the largest prescriber group of primary care physicians contributed less than expected, whereas hospital-affiliated outpatient care emerged as an important prescriber group with ca 20%. This type of surveillance builds the basis for sharing information with specific groups of physicians, which can help to improve the responsible use of antibiotics and address the rise of resistance.\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        PDF \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            health services research\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            antibiotics\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            claims data\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               Dispensed drugs during pregnancy in outpatient care between 2015 and 2021 in Switzerland: a retrospective analysis of Swiss healthcare claims data\n            \n            \n            \n                Carole A.

The analysis of 6,273 diabetic patients showed moderate but consistent improvements in guideline adherence across several performance measures, with the odds of receiving specific tests increasing by 18% to 58% after the incentive's implementation. The findings suggest that such incentive schemes, which promote transparency in performance, may enhance the quality of care for diabetes patients.\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        PDF \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            health services research\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            diabetes care\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            quality of care\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            claims data\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               «Dear Doctor»: Kommen Sicherheitswarnungen an?\n            \n            \n            \n                Sabrina M.

Paracetamol was the most commonly claimed analgesic (30.3% of pregnancies), antibiotics were dispensed in 26.3% of cases. Proton-pump-inhibitors and anti-nausea drugs were both claimed in around 16% of all pregnancies. While drug use largely followed treatment guidelines, exposure to potentially harmful drugs was minimal, though the lack of diagnosis data made it difficult to assess if their use was clinically justified.\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        PDF \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            health services research\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            drugs pregnancy\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            drug safety\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            claims data\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               Time trends in general practitioners' home visits for older patients: a retrospective cross-sectional study from Switzerland\n            \n            \n            \n                Stefan Neuner-Jehle, Sereina M.

The findings suggest that previous human care and social housing with other orangutans fostered curiosity, and that curiosity is the strongest predictor of problem-solving performance. However, curiosity is rare in wild orangutans, suggesting it may be an artefact of captivity. The origin of curiosity in our own lineage may have been an important contributor to the rapid rise in the complexity of our ancestors’ material culture. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            evolutionary biology\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            cognition\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               Significant improvement of olfactory performance in sleep apnea patients after three months of nasal CPAP therapy – Observational study and randomized trial\n            \n            \n            \n                Bettina Boerner, Gabrielo M.

This sections’ content builds on his explanations, however, his books offer much more comprehensive and detailed descriptions.\n\n\n\nBy default, lm() compares each treatment level against the control group (the first level of the factor).

The reference level can easily be changed in R using the function relevel(), e.g. for setting trt1 as the reference level: PlantGrowth$group &lt;- relevel(PlantGrowth$group, ref = 'trt1'). Changing the reference level might already help to assess certain comparisons of interest, but might not include all of them. Therefore, manually defined planned contrasts might be needed.\n\n\n\nTreatment Contrasts (default)\nIn order to understand how specific contrasts can be generated, it might be helpful to illustrate the setup based on the default setting from above.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematically the comparisons can be illustrated as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be translated into a matrix using a dummy coding scheme, with weights (grey numbers in the scheme on the left) indicating the individual comparisons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrast 1\n\n\nContrast 2\n\n\n\nGroup levels\ntrt1 vs. ctrl\ntrt2 vs. ctrl\n\n\n\n\nctrl\n-1\n-1\n\n\ntrt1\n1\n0\n\n\ntrt2\n0\n1\n\n\nsum\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese represent non-independent or non-orthogonal contrasts because the control group is used twice. Further details about orthogonal and non-orthogonal contrasts, see this section.\nThere are a couple of rules which need to be followed in order to set the contrasts matrix right:\n\n1: levels/groups with positive weights are compared to levels/groups with negative weights\n2: those groups not included in a contrast should be assigned weights of zero\n3: for each contrast, the sum of the weights need to add up to zero (last row).\n\n\n\n\nThe contrasts serve as dummy variables in the linear model:\n\\(w_{i} = b_{0} + b_{1}Contrast1_{i} + b_{2}Contrast2_{i}\\)\nwhere the mean of each group can be presented with the following formulas:\n\n\\(\\overline{w}_{ctrl} = b_{0} + (-1*b_{1}) + (-1*b_{2})\\)\n\\(\\overline{w}_{trt1} = b_{0} + ( 1*b_{1}) + ( 0*b_{2})\\)\n\\(\\overline{w}_{trt2} = b_{0} + ( 0*b_{1}) + ( 1*b_{2})\\)\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Contrasts\nOften, you’ll want to make specific comparisons that don’t align with the default contrasts. For example, you might want to compare:\n\nThe combined treatment groups vs. the control group\nThe difference between the two treatment groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese can be represented in a new contrast matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrast 1\n\n\nContrast 2\n\n\n\nGroup levels\ntrt1 + trt2 vs. ctrl\ntrt2 vs. trt1\n\n\n\n\nctrl\n-2\n0\n\n\ntrt1\n1\n-1\n\n\ntrt2\n1\n1\n\n\nsum\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese represent independent (orthogonal) contrasts, because each group is only used once. For the difference between orthogonal and non-orthogonal contrasts, again see this section."

    "section": "Implementing Contrasts",
    "text": "Implementing Contrasts\n\n\n\nI find Rose Maier’s article a great practical guide for implementing contrasts in R.\n\n\n\nR provides several predefined functions for setting contrasts automatically. For example, treatment contrasts can be implemented using contr.treatment(n = 3, base = 'ctrl'). Here, n specifies the number of factor levels, while base indicates the reference category. Other built-in options include Helmert contrasts, which can be set using contr.helmert(). In Helmert contrasts, each level is compared to the mean of the subsequent levels. For instance, with our data this would compare: \\(ctr\\) vs. \\(mean(trt_{1} + trt_{2})\\) and \\(trt_{1}\\) vs. \\(trt_{2}\\).\n\n\n\nTo see these custom contrasts in action, R offers three main approaches for implementing them (see also this converstation on stackoverflow):\n\nGlobal Contrast Settings: Set contrasts globally using options(\"contrasts\" = c('contr.helmert', 'contr.poly')). The first element stands for the contrasts in unordered, and the second for ordered factor variables. These become your default contrasts for all models.\nData Frame-Level Contrasts: Define contrasts directly in the data frame. For example, if the factor variable is releveled, the treatment contrast is adjusted accordingly in the data itself. Or one can set manually designed contrasts by using the following line of code: contrasts(PlantGrowth$group) &lt;- cbind(c(-2, 1, 1), c(0, -1, 1)). These correspond to the planned contrasts from above.\nModel-Level Specification: Specify contrasts in the model.\n\nusing contrasts argument within lm()\nusing glht() from the multcomp package\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third method offers the most flexibility and is my preferred way. Let’s explore the two main approaches within this method, using planned orthogonal contrast example from above.\n\n\nApproach I: contrasts argument within lm()\nInclude the inverse of contrast matrix in the contrasts-argument of lm()/ glm(). It is important to always take the inverse of the contrast matrix, otherwise the estimates get messed up and are not interpretable in the usual way.\nFirst, build the (orthogonal) contrasts matrix (make sure the weights are correctly ordered according to the order of the factor levels):\n\n\ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl &lt;- c(-2, 1, 1) \ntrt2_vs_trt1 &lt;- c(0, -1, 1) \n(contrast.matrix.orth &lt;- rbind(trt1plus2_vs_ctrl, trt2_vs_trt1))\n\n                  [,1] [,2] [,3]\ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl   -2    1    1\ntrt2_vs_trt1         0   -1    1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, take the inverse of the matrix (because the contrast argument expects the inverse):\n\n\ninv.contrast.matrix &lt;- MASS::ginv(contrast.matrix.orth)\ncolnames(inv.contrast.matrix) &lt;- rownames(contrast.matrix.orth); inv.contrast.matrix\n\n     trt1plus2_vs_ctrl  trt2_vs_trt1\n[1,]        -0.3333333  7.514131e-17\n[2,]         0.1666667 -5.000000e-01\n[3,]         0.1666667  5.000000e-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, run the linear model including the inverse matrix into the contrast argument:\n\n\nlm.mod.orth &lt;- lm(weight ~ group, \n                  data = PlantGrowth, \n                  contrasts = list(group = inv.contrast.matrix))\nsummary(lm.mod.orth)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, contrasts = list(group = inv.contrast.matrix))\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.0710 -0.4180 -0.0060  0.2627  1.3690 \n\nCoefficients:\n                       Estimate Std.

Here I use a different way of constructing the contrasts matrix:\n\n\nInput = \"\nContrast            ctrl  trt1   trt2\ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl    -2     1     1\ntrt2_vs_trt1          0    -1     1\n\"\n(contrast.matrix.orth &lt;- as.matrix(read.table(textConnection(Input),\n                                              header = T,\n                                              row.names = 1)))\n\n                  ctrl trt1 trt2\ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl   -2    1    1\ntrt2_vs_trt1         0   -1    1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, apply the glht() function from multcomp on the default model (lm.mod.nonorth) with the contrast matrix as the linear function (linfct) argument:\n\n\nglht.mod.orth &lt;- multcomp::glht(lm.mod.nonorth, linfct = mcp(group = contrast.matrix.orth))\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, get the summary statistics (for now using no adjustment for multiple testing):\n\n\nsummary(glht.mod.orth, test = adjusted('none'))\n\n\n     Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses\n\nMultiple Comparisons of Means: User-defined Contrasts\n\n\nFit: lm(formula = weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)\n\nLinear Hypotheses:\n                       Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)   \ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl == 0   0.1230     0.4829   0.255  0.80086   \ntrt2_vs_trt1 == 0        0.8650     0.2788   3.103  0.00446 **\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n(Adjusted p values reported -- none method)\n\n\n\n\nWhile the second approach may seem a bit less intuitive, it provides good options for controlling for multiple comparisons - for further information see the section on Handling Multiple Comparisons. For this reason, it’s my preferred method, especially when dealing with non-orthogonal contrasts.\n\n\n\nIf we were to use the same contrast setting as the default, the results would be identical to the default linear model lm.mod.nonorth without a contrast argument:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd On: Replicating Default Contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\nI recreated the default contrasts in glm()/lm() using the two approaches explained above, just to make sure I understand how they work:\n\nApproach I: contrasts argument within lm()\n\n\n# non-orthogonal contrasts matrix\ntrt1_vs_ctrl &lt;- c(-1, 1, 0) \ntrt2_vs_ctrl &lt;- c(-1, 0, 1) \ncontrast.matrix.nonorth &lt;- rbind(trt1_vs_ctrl, trt2_vs_ctrl)\n\n# inverse of matrix\ninv.contrast.matrix &lt;- MASS::ginv(contrast.matrix.nonorth)\ncolnames(inv.contrast.matrix) &lt;- rownames(contrast.matrix.nonorth)\n\n# run model with inverse contrasts matrix\nlm.mod.nonorth &lt;- lm(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, contrasts = list(group = inv.contrast.matrix))\nsummary(lm.mod.nonorth)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, contrasts = list(group = inv.contrast.matrix))\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.0710 -0.4180 -0.0060  0.2627  1.3690 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

    "text": "Orthogonal vs. Non-Orthogonal Contrasts\nUnderstanding the difference between orthogonal and non-orthogonal contrasts is essential, and also here Andy Field’s book (Field, Miles, and Field 2012) is as a great resource.\n\n\n\nIn brief:\n\nOrthogonal contrasts are independent comparisons. This means each data, and thus, variance component is only used once. No adjustment for multiple testing is needed.\nNon-orthogonal contrasts involve overlapping comparisons. They require adjustment for multiple testing to control the familywise/ experimentwise error rate (the probability of a Type I error increases when using the same data multiple times).\n\nTo determine if contrasts are orthogonal, we need to check if the sum of the row-wise contrast-products of the weights adds up to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthogonal Contrasts\nIn orthogonal contrasts, the sum of the row-wise contrast products of the weights always equals zero, indicating that the contrasts are independent. Below is the contrast matrix from above, now with an additional column showing the contrast products. At first glance, it may seem like trt1 and trt2 are used multiple times, raising doubts about the independence of these contrasts. However, each is only used once. The first contrast combines trt1 and trt2, representing a distinct variance component. The fact that the sum equals zero confirms that these contrasts are indeed independent (i.e., orthogonal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrast 1\n\n\nContrast 2\n\n\n\n\nGroup levels\ntrt1 + trt2 vs. ctrl\ntrt2 vs. trt1\nProduct of contrasts\n\n\n\n\nctrl\n-2\n0\n0\n\n\ntrt1\n1\n-1\n-1\n\n\ntrt2\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nsum\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-orthogonal Contrasts and the Multiplicity Problem\nIn non-orthogonal contrasts, the sum of the row-wise contrast products of the weights in the contrast matrix does not equal zero, indicating that the contrasts are not independent. For example, in default treatment contrasts, the control group is used multiple times:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrast 1\n\n\nContrast 2\n\n\n\n\nGroup levels\ntrt1 vs. ctrl\ntrt2 vs. ctrl\nProduct of contrasts\n\n\n\n\nctrl\n-1\n-1\n1\n\n\ntrt1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\ntrt2\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nsum\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis reuse of the control group creates overlapping variance components, which inflates our risk of false positives (elevated familywise error rate), and is known as the problem of multiplicity. To maintain valid statistical conclusions, we need to adjust for these multiple comparisons."

    "text": "Handling Multiple Comparisons\nWhen using R’s standard regression functions (lm(), glm(), etc.), we face three important issues:\n\nThey use non-orthogonal default contrasts (in case of factor variables with more than 2 levels)\nThey don’t automatically adjust for multiple comparisons\nThey provide no warning about the need for such adjustments\n\nLeft unaddressed, these issues can lead to Type I errors – finding “significant” differences that don’t actually exist. There are basically two approaches to handle this:\n\nOrthogonal Contrasts: Restructure the comparisons to be independent of each other. This may not be feasible if it doesn’t align with research questions.\nStatistical Adjustments: Apply multiple comparison procedures to adjust test statistics. This is recommended when orthogonal contrasts aren’t suitable.\n\n\n\n\nFor implementing these statistical adjustments, the multcomp package (Hothorn, Bretz, and Westfall 2008) provides robust tools for both testing and constructing confidence intervals.

The aim of this study was to compare different ICMs such as family-doctor models, and a standard care model (SCM) regarding patients’ drug safety in Swiss primary care.\n\n\n\nWe performed an observational study using health insurance claims data from patients who were continuously enrolled in an ICM or in a SCM between 2020 and 2021.

The aim of this study was to compare different ICMs such as family-doctor models, and a standard care model (SCM) regarding patients’ drug safety in Swiss primary care.\n\n\n\nWe performed an observational study using health insurance claims data from patients who were continuously enrolled in an ICM or in a SCM between 2020 and 2021. ICMs included family-doctor model (FDM), family-doctor model light (FDM-light) and the telemedicine model (TM). Drug safety was assessed by the prescription of potentially inappropriate proton pump-inhibitors (PIPPI), opioids (PIO), medications (PIM), and polypharmacy. Propensity-score-weighted multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between different types of ICMs and drug safety.\n\n\n\nPatients in FDM had significantly lower odds of receiving PIPPI (OR, 0.86; CI 95%, 0.83–0.89), PIO (OR, 0.81; CI 95%, 0.76–0.85), PIM (OR, 0.94; CI 95%, 0.91–0.97), and polypharmacy (OR, 0.94; CI 95%, 0.91–0.97) compared to patients in SCM. Potentially inappropriate prescribing was also lower in patients in TM and partly in FDM-light than in SCM. Persons enrolled in FDM were less likely to receive PIM (OR, 0.93; CI 95%, 0.89–0.97) and polypharmacy (OR, 0.94; CI 95%, 0.90–0.99) than those in FDM-light, whereas the odds of receiving PIPPI and polypharmacy were higher in FDM than in TM.\n\n\n\nICMs were significantly associated with higher drug safety compared to SCM for most outcomes. Findings suggest that patients may benefit most from ICMs with a high degree of coordination or gatekeeping. ICM may represent an effective approach to improve patients’ drug safety and, thus, to reduce the risk of adverse events."

    "text": "Evidence on the use of drugs during pregnancy in Switzerland is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the utilisation of drugs to treat chronic diseases during pregnancy in Switzerland. We identified all pregnancies (excluding abortions) in Swiss Helsana claims data (2014–2018). In those, we identified all claims for drugs to treat a chronic disease, which typically affects women of childbearing age. Potentially teratogenic/fetotoxic drugs were evaluated during specific risk periods. Results were demographically weighted relative to the Swiss population. We identified claims for ≥1 drug of interest during 22% of 369,371 weighted pregnancies. Levothyroxine was most frequently claimed (6.6%). Antihypertensives were claimed during 5.3% (3.9% nifedipine in T3). Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors were dispensed to 0.3/10,000 pregnancies during trimester 2 (T2) or trimester 3 (T3). Insulin was claimed during 3.5% of pregnancies, most frequently in T3 (3.3%). Exposure to psychotropic drugs was 3.8% (mostly Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) and to drugs for obstructive airway diseases 3.6%. Traditional immunosuppressants (excluding corticosteroids) were claimed during 0.5% (mainly azathioprine and hydroxychloroquine), biologic immunosuppressants (Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors and interleukin inhibitors) during 0.2%, and drugs to treat multiple sclerosis during 0.09% of pregnancies. Antiretrovirals were claimed during 0.15% of pregnancies. Patterns of drug claims were in line with treatment recommendations, but relatively rare events of in utero exposure to teratogenic drugs may have had severe implications for those involved."
