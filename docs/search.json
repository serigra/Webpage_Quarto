    "text": "Ellmer - Demistifying LLMs · Joe Cheng, CTO Posit\n\n\n\nJoe Cheng provided a concise overview of how LLMs work, explaining the core concepts that are essential for anyone looking to use them effectively. Joe showcased three R packages ({ellmer}, {shinychat}, {querychat}) designed to interface with large language models (LLMs), making it easy for developers to build interactive, AI-driven applications. In addition to the packages, he also introduced the concept of Tool Calling — a feature that enables LLMs to invoke external functions or tools to extend their capabilities, i.e. supply the LLM with up-to-date, real-time data.\nHe compared the strengths of different LLM providers, noting that OpenAI’s models excel at general-purpose tasks and conversation, while Anthropic’s models tend to perform better in code generation. Finally, he shared practical tips for prompt engineering, showing how thoughtful prompt design can significantly improve model performance and output quality.\nFind the slides here and workshop material here.\n\n\n  \n\nprovides unified R interface to a variety of LLMs & providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc), supporting streaming output, extraction of structured data and tool calling.

CDISC ARS (Analysis Results Standard) defines how these results and their metadata should be structured, linked, and documented, enabling automation, reproducibility, and fully auditable traceability supporting regulatory submissions (CDISC is the organisation making the standards).\nThe {cards} package builds on the functionality of {gtsummary} to make creating ARDs simple and efficient, while its companion, {cardx}, extends these capabilities, allowing you to export ARDs from a wide range of statistical methods and packages including {geepack}, {lme4} and {survival}.\nFind the material and slides here and some further material from the R/ Pharma workshop in 2024:\nA Practical Workshop for Creating and Utilizing ARDs for Clinical Reporting."

Antibiotics are predominantly prescribed in the outpatient setting, which consists of primary care, specialist care and hospital-affiliated outpatient care. In Switzerland, current surveillance takes place at aggregated levels and the contribution of the different prescribers to the overall consumption remains unknown.

The study distinguishes between selective drivers and evolutionary consequences, revealing that ecological factors, rather than social complexity, are key to brain expansion. High levels of social complexity in primates emerged as a consequence of large brains, which were enabled by favorable ecological conditions.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n          \n           \n            PDF \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n  Seasonality and Brain Size - Cognitive Buffering is Unique to Anthropoid Primates\n   \n      \n        \n          Talk @ American Association of Physical Anthropologists Meeting, Apr 15, 2016, Atlanta, USA\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          The expensive brain hypothesis suggests that seasonal environments impose energetic limits on brain size evolution, while the cognitive buffering hypothesis suggests that larger-brained species are better able to adapt to seasonal challenges. In a study of 41 non-primate mammals, species with higher seasonality had smaller brain sizes, confirming the patterns seen in primates, but finding weak support for cognitive buffering. Overall, energetic constraints appear to play a key role in the evolution of brain size, with cognitive buffering appearing to be more pronounced in large-brained species, especially anthropoid primates.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n          \n           \n            PDF \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n  Cooperative breeding and hominin brain size evolution - Evidence from a comparative study in birds\n   \n      \n        \n          Poster @ American Association of Physical Anthropologists Meeting, Apr 9, 2012, Portland, USA\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          In mammals, allomaternal energy inputs correlate with either large brains or increased reproductive rates. In this study we investigated the effects of allomaternal care on brain size and life history in birds. First, we showed that energetic input during breeding correlates with relative brain size. Second, we found that helpers in birds do not increase brain size or reproduction but rather increase the survival rates of parents. These findings in birds enhance our understanding of how cooperative breeding may have shaped hominin evolution.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n          \n           \n            PDF \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nNo matching items"

It found that almost 90% of pregnant women claimed at least one drug (excluding vitamins and vaccines), with one third claiming at least five distinct drugs during pregnancy. The study highlights that while most drugs used during pregnancy are well-researched and considered safe, the high drug burden in pregnant women emphasizes the need for robust evidence on the benefit-risk profile of medications taken during this vulnerable period.\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        PDF \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            health services research\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            drugs pregnancy\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            drug safety\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            claims data\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               Real-world treatment patterns and medical costs of prostate cancer patients in Switzerland - A claims data analysis\n            \n            \n            \n                Michael Stucki, Stephanie Dosch, Markus Gnädinger, Sereina M.

In this comparative analysis of 1,176 bird species, various measures of parental provisioning were found to strongly predict relative brain size, indicating that parental care may be a strategy to overcome the energetic limitations of brain growth.\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        PDF \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            evolutionary biology\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            brain size\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               The economics of brain size evolution in vertebrates\n            \n            \n            \n                Sandra A.

Die Resultate aus einer aktuellen Studie deuten auf eine potenzielle Versorgungslücke hin, die möglicherweise durch zusätzliches Gesundheitspersonal oder bessere Vergütungsmodelle geschlossen werden könnte.\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        PDF \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            health services research\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            GP home visits\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            claims data\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               Use of Prescribed Drugs to Treat Chronic Diseases during Pregnancy in Outpatient Care in Switzerland between 2014 and 2018: Descriptive Analysis of Swiss Health Care Claims Data\n            \n            \n            \n                Eva Gerbier, Sereina M.

Paracetamol was the most commonly claimed analgesic (30.3% of pregnancies), antibiotics were dispensed in 26.3% of cases. Proton-pump-inhibitors and anti-nausea drugs were both claimed in around 16% of all pregnancies. While drug use largely followed treatment guidelines, exposure to potentially harmful drugs was minimal, though the lack of diagnosis data made it difficult to assess if their use was clinically justified.\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        PDF \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            health services research\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            drugs pregnancy\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            drug safety\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            claims data\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               Time trends in general practitioners' home visits for older patients: a retrospective cross-sectional study from Switzerland\n            \n            \n            \n                Stefan Neuner-Jehle, Sereina M.

Despite decreasing exposure prevalence, the use of valproate in women of childbearing age in Switzerland seems higher than the actual clinical need.\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        PDF \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            health services research\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            drugs pregnancy\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            drug safety\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            claims data\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               Comparing Two Imaging Methods for Follow-Up of Lung Cancer Treatment: A Randomized Pilot Study\n            \n            \n            \n                Franco Gambazzi, Lukas D.

The findings suggest that previous human care and social housing with other orangutans fostered curiosity, and that curiosity is the strongest predictor of problem-solving performance. However, curiosity is rare in wild orangutans, suggesting it may be an artefact of captivity. The origin of curiosity in our own lineage may have been an important contributor to the rapid rise in the complexity of our ancestors’ material culture. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            evolutionary biology\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            cognition\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               Significant improvement of olfactory performance in sleep apnea patients after three months of nasal CPAP therapy – Observational study and randomized trial\n            \n            \n            \n                Bettina Boerner, Gabrielo M.

The study proposes a social learning spectrum to classify different types of social learning, which, once validated, could help assess the cognitive demands of social learning in various species.\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        URL \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            evolutionary biology\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            cognition\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n               Life history, cognition and the evolution of complex foraging niches\n            \n            \n            \n                Caroline Schuppli, Sereina M.

Nonetheless, the high energetic costs of brain tissue may have prevented the evolution of large brains in many species. This problem may also have a developmental dimension: juveniles, with their immature and therefore poorly performing brains, would face a major energetic hurdle if they were to pay for the construction of their own brain, especially in larger-brained species. Here, we explore the possible role of parental provisioning for the development and evolution of adult brain size in birds. A comparative analysis of 1,176 bird species shows that various measures of parental provisioning (precocial vs. altricial state at hatching, relative egg mass, time spent provisioning the young) strongly predict relative brain size across species. The parental provisioning hypothesis also provides an explanation for the well-documented but so far unexplained pattern that altricial birds have larger brains than precocial ones. We therefore conclude that the evolution of parental provisioning allowed species to overcome the seemingly insurmountable energetic constraint on growing large brains, which in turn enabled bird species to increase survival and population stability. Because including adult eco- and socio-cognitive predictors only marginally improved the explanatory value of our models, these findings also suggest that the traditionally assessed cognitive abilities largely support successful parental provisioning. Our results therefore indicate that the cognitive adaptations underlying successful parental provisioning also provide the behavioral flexibility facilitating reproductive success and survival."

Two pre-existing diabetes indicators were updated.\nConclusions\nAdditional QI relating to overuse and intersectoral care aspects extend the options of measuring quality of primary care in Switzerland based on claims data and complement the initial QI set."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nMedical treatment quality has been shown to be better in high volume than in low volume hospitals. However, this relationship has not yet been confirmed in abdominal cancer in Switzerland and is relevant for referral of patients and healthcare planning. Thus, the present study investigates the association between hospital volumes for surgical resections of colon, gastric, rectal, and pancreatic carcinomas and outcomes.\nMethods\nThis retrospective analysis is based on anonymized claims data of patients with mandatory health insurance at Helsana Group, a leading health insurance in Switzerland. Outcome parameters were length of hospital stay, mortality and cost during the inpatient stay as well as at 1-year follow-up. Hospital volume information was derived from the Quality Indicators dataset provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. The impact of hospital volume on the different treatment outcomes was statistically tested using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, taking into account the non-independence of observations from the same hospital.\nResults\nThe studies included 2′859 resections in patients aged 18 years and older who were hospitalized for abdominal cancer surgery between 2014 and 2018. Colon resections were the most common procedures (n = 1′690), followed by rectal resections (n = 709). For rectal, colon and pancreatic resections, an increase in the mean number of interventions per hospital and a reduction of low volume hospitals could be observed. For the relationship between hospital volume and outcomes, we did not observe a clear dose-response relationship, as no significantly better outcomes were observed in the higher-volume category than in the lower-volume category. Even though a positive “routine effect” cannot be excluded, our results suggest that even hospitals with low volumes are able to achieve comparable treatment outcomes to larger hospitals.\nConclusions\nIn summary, this study increases transparency on the relationship between hospital volume and treatment success. It shows that simple measures such as defining a minimum number of procedures only might not lead to the intended effects if other factors such as infrastructure, the operating team or aggregation level of the available data are not taken into account."

We identified claims for the following drugs during pregnancy; analgesics (opioids, paracetamol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), oral antibiotics, antacids, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), anti-nausea drugs (propulsives and 5HT3-antagonists), and laxatives. Within these drug groups we quantified exposure prevalence to the most prescribed drugs (to &gt;1% of pregnancies) during pregnancy as well as to specific potentially teratogenic or fetotoxic drugs during specific risk periods. Results were extrapolated relative to the demographic distribution of the Swiss population.\nResults\nWe identified an extrapolated population of 369,371 pregnancies, with a weighted mean maternal age of 32.0 years (weighted standard deviation 5.1). Analgesics were claimed in 34.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.9–35.0%) of pregnancies, most frequently paracetamol (30.3%, 29.8–30.8%), followed by NSAIDs (8.6%, 8.3–8.8%), and opioids (2.6%, 2.4–2.8%).

We established two separate study populations: (1) a cohort of pregnancies leading to a delivery, and (2) all women of childbearing age (15–45 years) who were insured with Helsana for at least one year during the study period. We identified the dispensation of valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, topiramate, pregabalin, gabapentin, phenobarbital, and phenytoin (1) between delivery and three months prior to the estimated date of the last menstrual period, and (2) by calendar year. We quantified exposure prevalence of each antiseizure drug as the number of women with ≥1 prescription fill per 10,000 (1) pregnancies, and (2) women by calendar year.

We find that the majority of species retained the birth seasonality displayed in the wild. Latitude of natural origin, delayed implantation, and induced ovulation were the main factors influencing reproductive seasonality. Most species were short-day breeders, but there was no evidence of an absolute photoperiodic signal for the timing of mating or conception. The length of the gestation period (corrected for body mass) generally decreased with birth seasonality but increased in species with delayed implantation. Birth seasons become shorter with increasing latitude of geographical origin, likely because the length of the favorable season declines with increasing latitude, exerting a strong selective pressure on fitting both the reproductive cycle and the interval offspring needs for growth following the termination of parental care into the short time window of optimal environmental conditions. Species with induced ovulation exhibit a less seasonal reproductive pattern, potentially because mates do not have to meet during a short time window of a fixed ovulation. Seasonal species of Carnivora shorten their gestation period so reproduction can occur during the short time window of optimal environmental conditions. Alternatively, other Carnivora species lengthen their gestation periods in order to bridge long winters.

Because human food procurement is uniquely complex, we ask here which conditions may have allowed species to evolve into such complex foraging niches, and also how niche complexity is related to relative brain size. To do so, we divided niche complexity into a knowledge-learning and a motor-learning dimension. Using a sample of 78 primate and 65 carnivoran species, we found that two life-history features are consistently correlated with complex niches: slow, conservative development or provisioning of offspring over extended periods of time. Both act to buffer low energy yields during periods of learning, and may thus act as limiting factors for the evolution of complex niches. Our results further showed that the knowledge and motor dimensions of niche complexity were correlated with pace of development in primates only, and with the length of provisioning in only carnivorans. Accordingly, in primates, but not carnivorans, living in a complex foraging niche requires enhanced cognitive abilities, i.e., a large brain. The patterns in these two groups of mammals show that selection favors evolution into complex niches (in either the knowledge or motor dimension) in species that either develop more slowly or provision their young for an extended period of time. These findings help to explain how humans constructed by far the most complex niche: our ancestors managed to combine slow development (as in other primates) with systematic provisioning of immatures and even adults (as in carnivorans).

The example is based on a hypothetical model output that includes odds ratios of sociodemographic and health variables on some binary outcome.\nNote I: The scrollytelling framework is made using the closeread Quarto extension. The code highlighting is done using the line-highlight Quarto extension, which allows to highlight specific lines of code. For table formatting {gt} is used and for plotting {ggplot2}.\nNote II: You’ll find the complete code for both generating the hypothetical model data and creating the visualization at the end of this post. The data preparation steps are not broken down individually, but are only found consolidated in the final code section.\nNow let`s start building up the plot step by step.\nThat’s it!

We learned about different forms of disclosure (re-identification), the risk-utility trade-off, and the different disclosure methods. These methods correspond basically to two approaches:\n\nAltering original data using non-perturbative or perturbative masking.\nGenerating synthetic data based on models trained on real world data.\n\nConsidering approach (1), we learned about the functionalities of the sdcMicro package by Matthias Templ and colleagues. It allows you not only to actually anonymise data sets, but in addition offers tools to calculate global as well as individual risk propabilities of subjects being re-identifiable. This allows you to monitor and compare the “degree of anonymization”, which might be especially helpful for establishing a structured and streamlined process in the context of making sensitive data publicly available to others.\nMain take home message for myself are that there is more to data anonymization than altering/ aggregating/ suppression the original data, but that one should also think of synthesizing data sets."

The regression coefficients represent the differences in means between each treatment and the control group (\\(\\overline{w}_{k}\\) = mean weight of group k):\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup means:\n\n\nR Code\nPlantGrowth %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean = mean(weight))\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  group  mean\n  &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ctrl   5.03\n2 trt1   4.66\n3 trt2   5.53\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences in means:\n\n\\(\\overline{w}_{trt1} - \\overline{w}_{ctrl}\\) = 4.66 - 5.03 = -0.371\n\\(\\overline{w}_{trt2} - \\overline{w}_{ctrl}\\) = 5.53 - 5.03 = 0.494\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese default comparisons are known as treatment contrasts. The reference level can easily be changed in R using the function relevel(), e.g. for setting trt1 as the reference level: PlantGrowth$group &lt;- relevel(PlantGrowth$group, ref = 'trt1'). Changing the reference level might already help to assess certain comparisons of interest, but might not include all of them. Therefore, manually defined planned contrasts might be needed.\n\n\n\nTreatment Contrasts (default)\nIn order to understand how specific contrasts can be generated, it might be helpful to illustrate the setup based on the default setting from above.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematically the comparisons can be illustrated as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be translated into a matrix using a dummy coding scheme, with weights (grey numbers in the scheme on the left) indicating the individual comparisons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrast 1\n\n\nContrast 2\n\n\n\nGroup levels\ntrt1 vs. ctrl\ntrt2 vs. ctrl\n\n\n\n\nctrl\n-1\n-1\n\n\ntrt1\n1\n0\n\n\ntrt2\n0\n1\n\n\nsum\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese represent non-independent or non-orthogonal contrasts because the control group is used twice. Further details about orthogonal and non-orthogonal contrasts, see this section.\nThere are a couple of rules which need to be followed in order to set the contrasts matrix right:\n\n1: levels/groups with positive weights are compared to levels/groups with negative weights\n2: those groups not included in a contrast should be assigned weights of zero\n3: for each contrast, the sum of the weights need to add up to zero (last row).\n\n\n\n\nThe contrasts serve as dummy variables in the linear model:\n\\(w_{i} = b_{0} + b_{1}Contrast1_{i} + b_{2}Contrast2_{i}\\)\nwhere the mean of each group can be presented with the following formulas:\n\n\\(\\overline{w}_{ctrl} = b_{0} + (-1*b_{1}) + (-1*b_{2})\\)\n\\(\\overline{w}_{trt1} = b_{0} + ( 1*b_{1}) + ( 0*b_{2})\\)\n\\(\\overline{w}_{trt2} = b_{0} + ( 0*b_{1}) + ( 1*b_{2})\\)\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Contrasts\nOften, you’ll want to make specific comparisons that don’t align with the default contrasts. For example, you might want to compare:\n\nThe combined treatment groups vs. the control group\nThe difference between the two treatment groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese can be represented in a new contrast matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrast 1\n\n\nContrast 2\n\n\n\nGroup levels\ntrt1 + trt2 vs. ctrl\ntrt2 vs. trt1\n\n\n\n\nctrl\n-2\n0\n\n\ntrt1\n1\n-1\n\n\ntrt2\n1\n1\n\n\nsum\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese represent independent (orthogonal) contrasts, because each group is only used once.

    "section": "Implementing Contrasts",
    "text": "Implementing Contrasts\n\n\n\nI find Rose Maier’s article a great practical guide for implementing contrasts in R.\n\n\n\nR provides several predefined functions for setting contrasts automatically. For example, treatment contrasts can be implemented using contr.treatment(n = 3, base = 'ctrl'). Here, n specifies the number of factor levels, while base indicates the reference category. Other built-in options include Helmert contrasts, which can be set using contr.helmert(). In Helmert contrasts, each level is compared to the mean of the subsequent levels. For instance, with our data this would compare: \\(ctr\\) vs. \\(mean(trt_{1} + trt_{2})\\) and \\(trt_{1}\\) vs. \\(trt_{2}\\).\n\n\n\nTo see these custom contrasts in action, R offers three main approaches for implementing them (see also this converstation on stackoverflow):\n\nGlobal Contrast Settings: Set contrasts globally using options(\"contrasts\" = c('contr.helmert', 'contr.poly')). The first element stands for the contrasts in unordered, and the second for ordered factor variables. These become your default contrasts for all models.\nData Frame-Level Contrasts: Define contrasts directly in the data frame. For example, if the factor variable is releveled, the treatment contrast is adjusted accordingly in the data itself. Or one can set manually designed contrasts by using the following line of code: contrasts(PlantGrowth$group) &lt;- cbind(c(-2, 1, 1), c(0, -1, 1)). These correspond to the planned contrasts from above.\nModel-Level Specification: Specify contrasts in the model.\n\nusing contrasts argument within lm()\nusing glht() from the multcomp package\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third method offers the most flexibility and is my preferred way. Let’s explore the two main approaches within this method, using planned orthogonal contrast example from above.\n\n\nApproach I: contrasts argument within lm()\nInclude the inverse of contrast matrix in the contrasts-argument of lm()/ glm(). It is important to always take the inverse of the contrast matrix, otherwise the estimates get messed up and are not interpretable in the usual way.\nFirst, build the (orthogonal) contrasts matrix (make sure the weights are correctly ordered according to the order of the factor levels):\n\n\ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl &lt;- c(-2, 1, 1) \ntrt2_vs_trt1 &lt;- c(0, -1, 1) \n(contrast.matrix.orth &lt;- rbind(trt1plus2_vs_ctrl, trt2_vs_trt1))\n\n                  [,1] [,2] [,3]\ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl   -2    1    1\ntrt2_vs_trt1         0   -1    1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, take the inverse of the matrix (because the contrast argument expects the inverse):\n\n\ninv.contrast.matrix &lt;- MASS::ginv(contrast.matrix.orth)\ncolnames(inv.contrast.matrix) &lt;- rownames(contrast.matrix.orth); inv.contrast.matrix\n\n     trt1plus2_vs_ctrl  trt2_vs_trt1\n[1,]        -0.3333333  7.514131e-17\n[2,]         0.1666667 -5.000000e-01\n[3,]         0.1666667  5.000000e-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, run the linear model including the inverse matrix into the contrast argument:\n\n\nlm.mod.orth &lt;- lm(weight ~ group, \n                  data = PlantGrowth, \n                  contrasts = list(group = inv.contrast.matrix))\nsummary(lm.mod.orth)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, contrasts = list(group = inv.contrast.matrix))\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.0710 -0.4180 -0.0060  0.2627  1.3690 \n\nCoefficients:\n                       Estimate Std.

Here I use a different way of constructing the contrasts matrix:\n\n\nInput = \"\nContrast            ctrl  trt1   trt2\ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl    -2     1     1\ntrt2_vs_trt1          0    -1     1\n\"\n(contrast.matrix.orth &lt;- as.matrix(read.table(textConnection(Input),\n                                              header = T,\n                                              row.names = 1)))\n\n                  ctrl trt1 trt2\ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl   -2    1    1\ntrt2_vs_trt1         0   -1    1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, apply the glht() function from multcomp on the default model (lm.mod.nonorth) with the contrast matrix as the linear function (linfct) argument:\n\n\nglht.mod.orth &lt;- multcomp::glht(lm.mod.nonorth, linfct = mcp(group = contrast.matrix.orth))\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, get the summary statistics (for now using no adjustment for multiple testing):\n\n\nsummary(glht.mod.orth, test = adjusted('none'))\n\n\n     Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses\n\nMultiple Comparisons of Means: User-defined Contrasts\n\n\nFit: lm(formula = weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)\n\nLinear Hypotheses:\n                       Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)   \ntrt1plus2_vs_ctrl == 0   0.1230     0.4829   0.255  0.80086   \ntrt2_vs_trt1 == 0        0.8650     0.2788   3.103  0.00446 **\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n(Adjusted p values reported -- none method)\n\n\n\n\nWhile the second approach may seem a bit less intuitive, it provides good options for controlling for multiple comparisons - for further information see the section on Handling Multiple Comparisons. For this reason, it’s my preferred method, especially when dealing with non-orthogonal contrasts.\n\n\n\nIf we were to use the same contrast setting as the default, the results would be identical to the default linear model lm.mod.nonorth without a contrast argument:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd On: Replicating Default Contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\nI recreated the default contrasts in glm()/lm() using the two approaches explained above, just to make sure I understand how they work:\n\nApproach I: contrasts argument within lm()\n\n\n# non-orthogonal contrasts matrix\ntrt1_vs_ctrl &lt;- c(-1, 1, 0) \ntrt2_vs_ctrl &lt;- c(-1, 0, 1) \ncontrast.matrix.nonorth &lt;- rbind(trt1_vs_ctrl, trt2_vs_ctrl)\n\n# inverse of matrix\ninv.contrast.matrix &lt;- MASS::ginv(contrast.matrix.nonorth)\ncolnames(inv.contrast.matrix) &lt;- rownames(contrast.matrix.nonorth)\n\n# run model with inverse contrasts matrix\nlm.mod.nonorth &lt;- lm(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, contrasts = list(group = inv.contrast.matrix))\nsummary(lm.mod.nonorth)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, contrasts = list(group = inv.contrast.matrix))\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.0710 -0.4180 -0.0060  0.2627  1.3690 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

    "text": "Orthogonal vs. Non-Orthogonal Contrasts\nUnderstanding the difference between orthogonal and non-orthogonal contrasts is essential, and also here Andy Field’s book (Field, Miles, and Field 2012) is as a great resource.\n\n\n\nIn brief:\n\nOrthogonal contrasts are independent comparisons. This means each data, and thus, variance component is only used once. No adjustment for multiple testing is needed.\nNon-orthogonal contrasts involve overlapping comparisons. They require adjustment for multiple testing to control the familywise/ experimentwise error rate (the probability of a Type I error increases when using the same data multiple times).\n\nTo determine if contrasts are orthogonal, we need to check if the sum of the row-wise contrast-products of the weights adds up to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthogonal Contrasts\nIn orthogonal contrasts, the sum of the row-wise contrast products of the weights always equals zero, indicating that the contrasts are independent. Below is the contrast matrix from above, now with an additional column showing the contrast products. At first glance, it may seem like trt1 and trt2 are used multiple times, raising doubts about the independence of these contrasts. However, each is only used once. The first contrast combines trt1 and trt2, representing a distinct variance component. The fact that the sum equals zero confirms that these contrasts are indeed independent (i.e., orthogonal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrast 1\n\n\nContrast 2\n\n\n\n\nGroup levels\ntrt1 + trt2 vs. ctrl\ntrt2 vs. trt1\nProduct of contrasts\n\n\n\n\nctrl\n-2\n0\n0\n\n\ntrt1\n1\n-1\n-1\n\n\ntrt2\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nsum\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-orthogonal Contrasts and the Multiplicity Problem\nIn non-orthogonal contrasts, the sum of the row-wise contrast products of the weights in the contrast matrix does not equal zero, indicating that the contrasts are not independent. For example, in default treatment contrasts, the control group is used multiple times:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrast 1\n\n\nContrast 2\n\n\n\n\nGroup levels\ntrt1 vs. ctrl\ntrt2 vs. ctrl\nProduct of contrasts\n\n\n\n\nctrl\n-1\n-1\n1\n\n\ntrt1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\ntrt2\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nsum\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis reuse of the control group creates overlapping variance components, which inflates our risk of false positives (elevated familywise error rate), and is known as the problem of multiplicity. To maintain valid statistical conclusions, we need to adjust for these multiple comparisons."

    "text": "Handling Multiple Comparisons\nWhen using R’s standard regression functions (lm(), glm(), etc.), we face three important issues:\n\nThey use non-orthogonal default contrasts (in case of factor variables with more than 2 levels)\nThey don’t automatically adjust for multiple comparisons\nThey provide no warning about the need for such adjustments\n\nLeft unaddressed, these issues can lead to Type I errors – finding “significant” differences that don’t actually exist. There are basically two approaches to handle this:\n\nOrthogonal Contrasts: Restructure the comparisons to be independent of each other. This may not be feasible if it doesn’t align with research questions.\nStatistical Adjustments: Apply multiple comparison procedures to adjust test statistics. This is recommended when orthogonal contrasts aren’t suitable.\n\n\n\n\nFor implementing these statistical adjustments, the multcomp package (Hothorn, Bretz, and Westfall 2008) provides robust tools for both testing and constructing confidence intervals.

This difficulty is especially pronounced for non-statisticians, who are often the ones tasked with translating results into practical solutions. In this regard, marginal effects can be useful, as they provide a clearer and more interpretable view of the relationships within a statistical model.\nThe term “marginal effects” carries slightly different meanings across different fields and contexts. For an in-depth exploration of this terminology, I recommend to read Andrew Heiss’s blog post. For the following, I’ll adhere to the following general concept: Marginal effects illustrate how a one-unit change in the independent variable influences the dependent variable, while holding other factors or covariates constant. This concept manifests differently across model types:\nIn the following sections, I’ll explore two examples of how to enhance the interpretability of model outputs using marginal effects and the marginaleffects package.\nNote I: While researching marginal effects, I found two particularly insightful blog posts - one by an unnamed author from the University of Virginia and another by Andrew Heiss. Both offer comprehensive descriptions of the concept. However, in this post, I’ve attempted to articulate the idea behind marginal effects in my own words, hoping to provide a perspective that might be helpful to others, including my future self.\nNote II: There are several other excellent R packages for calculating marginal effects, such as margins and emmeans. However, for the sake of simplicity and consistency, I chose not to include them in this post."

    "text": "Unraveling Curved Relationships: Marginal Effects Between Continuous Variables\nWhen dealing with continuous variables for both predictors and outcomes, marginal effects become a powerful tool for interpretation of non-linear models like quadratic relationships, where raw regression estimates are challenging to interpret. Let’s explore this concept using a synthetic data set on plant growth and fertilizer. The data follows a natural inverted U-shaped curve that’s commonly observed in agriculture: plants respond positively to fertilizer up to an optimal point (around 3 g/m²), after which excess nutrients become toxic and inhibit growth, demonstrating a classic quadratic relationship.\nData set\n\nset.seed(123)\nx &lt;- seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)             # Fertilizer amount\ny &lt;- -2*x^2 + 10*x + 5 + rnorm(100, sd = 20)  # Plant growth\nplant_data &lt;- data.frame(fertilizer = x, growth = y)\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear vs. Quadratic: Which Fits Better?\nFirst, let’s compare a linear and a quadratic model to see which better describes the data.\n\n\nR Code\n# plot\nggplot(plant_data, aes(x = fertilizer, y = growth) ) +\n    geom_point(color = 'black', fill = '#7950f2', alpha = 0.6,  shape = 21, size = 3) +\n    stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x, linewidth = 1, color = '#1e1e1e') +\n    labs(title = 'Linear Model',\n         x = expression(paste(\"Fertilizer [g/\", m^2, ']')), y = \"Growth [cm]\")\n# linear model\nlinear_model &lt;- lm(growth ~ fertilizer, data = plant_data)\nsummary(linear_model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = growth ~ fertilizer, data = plant_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-57.819 -12.129   0.943  14.774  58.039 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This improved fit suggests a more complex relationship between fertilizer and plant growth: rather than a simple, monotonic decline, the data indicate that growth initially increases with fertilizer use, reaching a peak around 3 g/m², after which it starts to decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuadratic term: raw vs. orthogonal polynomials\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen fitting a quadratic or higher-order polynomial model in R, there are two common ways to include polynomial terms: using x + I(x^2) or poly(x, 2). Both approaches capture quadratic relationships, but they differ significantly in how the terms are constructed.\n\nx + I(x^2) (equivalent to poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE)) includes the raw polynomial terms directly—i.e., the variable \\(x\\) and its square \\(x^2\\). These terms are generally easier to interpret — at least in theory — since the coefficients correspond directly to the linear and quadratic parts of the model. (Though in practice, I still find their meaning tricky to pin down — the reason why marginal effects are so useful.). However, raw polynomial terms tend to be highly correlated, which can introduce multicollinearity and affect the reliability of coefficient estimates.\npoly(x, 2) by default creates orthogonal polynomials—transformed versions of the original terms that are statistically uncorrelated. This helps mitigate multicollinearity, but comes at the cost of interpretability: the coefficients no longer directly correspond to powers of the predictor.\n\nA more nuanced discussion of the trade-offs and appropriate use cases for each approach can be found on CrossValidated.\nHowever, in the current context of marginal effects, the choice between them is less important, since both methods yield identical marginal effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting Quadratic Relationships: The Power of Marginal Effects\nInterpreting the coefficients in quadratic or higher-order polynomial models — whether based on raw or orthogonal terms — can be tricky and often unintuitive. This is where marginal effects, specifically Marginal Effects at Representative Values (MER), come into play. We can calculate the slope (or tangent) at different amounts of fertilizer to better understand the relationship, and these slopes are nothing else than marginal effects. Let’s calculate the marginal effects at 2 g/m² and 6 g/m² using the slopes() function from the marginaleffects package:\n\n\nslopes(quadratic_model, newdata = datagrid(fertilizer = c(1.5, 6))) -&gt; s;\nprint(s, ncols = 0, type = FALSE)\n\n\n       Term fertilizer Estimate Std.

The slope is positive at the amount of 1.5 g/m² but negative at 6 g/m², indicating a clear shift in the relationship.\n\n\n\nComprehensive View: Marginal Effects Across All Ages\nTo get a complete picture, we can calculate and plot the marginal effects (slopes) for all amounts of fertilizer using the plot_slopes() function:\n\n\n\nR Code\nplot_slopes(quadratic_model, variables = \"fertilizer\", condition = \"fertilizer\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = 'darkgrey', linetype = 'dotted', lwd = 1) +\n  geom_richtext(data = d.annot, aes(x = x, y = b, label = label), color = 'darkorange', nudge_y = 3.5) +\n  geom_point(data = d.annot, aes(x = x, y = b), fill = 'darkorange', shape = 21, size = 4) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, by=1.5)) +\n  labs(title = 'Marginal Effects Across All Amounts of Fertilizer',\n       y = 'Marginal Effect (dy/dx)', x = expression(paste(\"Fertilizer [g/\", m^2, ']')))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe analysis reveals that:\n\nAt 1.5 g/m² of fertilizer: A one-unit increase in fertilizer (from 1.5 to 2.5 g/m²) is associated with an estimated 2.8 cm increase in plant growth.\nAt 6 g/m² of fertilizer: A one-unit increase in fertilizer (from 6 to 7 g/m²) is associated with an estimated 13 cm decrease in plant growth.\n\nThis shift from a positive to a negative relationship when increasing the amount of fertilizer illustrates that at lower levels (before the optimum), additional fertilizer promotes growth, and at higher levels (after the optimum), additional fertilizer reduces growth due to toxicity.\n\n\n\nBeyond MER: Exploring MEM and AME\nWe’ve just looked at the concept of Marginal Effects at Representative Values (MER). But there’s more! Two other concepts can shed light on the data (depending on context and data, one or the other make more sense): MEM and AME.

    "text": "Unravelling Logistic Regression and Marginal Effects\nLogistic regression is a powerful and often used tool. The raw parameters represent log odds ratios, expressed as \\(log(\\frac{p}{1-p})\\). Exponentiating these coefficients results in odds ratios \\(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\), which is a common measure used in scientific studies. But what do these really mean in practical terms? The interpretation can be tricky, and it’s easy to conflate odds with probabilities. While it would be convenient if they were the same, they’re not – and this is where marginal effects shine.\nLet’s explore this concept using the diabetes data from the github repository for plotly sample data sets. We’ll investigate how glucose levels and body mass index (BMI) — specifically values of 25 or higher, which are classified as overweight (coded as a binary variable) — are associated with the risk of developing diabetes. This example is simplified for illustration, and is simply used to provide insights into marginal effects in case of a binary coded outcome variable.\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s prepare our data:\n\ndiab_data &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/diabetes.csv\")\ndiab_data &lt;- diab_data |&gt;  \n  rename_with(tolower) |&gt; \n  mutate(diab = outcome,\n         bmi_fg = f_case_when(bmi &lt; 25 ~ 'BMI &lt; 25',\n                              bmi &gt;= 25 ~ 'BMI ≥ 25'))\n\n\n\n\nLets build the model:\n\n\nR Code\n# plot: glucose\np1 &lt;- ggplot(diab_data, aes(x = glucose, y = diab)) + \n  geom_point(fill = '#7950f2', alpha = 0.3,  shape = 21, size = 2) +\n  stat_smooth(method=\"glm\", color=\"black\", se=TRUE, method.args = list(family=binomial), linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = 'Logistic Regression - Glucose',\n       y = 'Probability of Diabetes', x = 'Glucose') +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 9),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 11))\n\n# plot: BMI binary coded\np2 &lt;- ggplot(diab_data, aes(x = bmi_fg, y = diab)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, height = 0.05, fill = '#7950f2', alpha = 0.3,  shape = 21, size = 2) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", size = 3.5, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", method.args = list(family = \"binomial\"), se = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"BMI\", y = \"Probability of Diabetes\", title = \"Logistic Regression - BMI Flag\") +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 9),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 11))\n\np1+p2+plot_annotation(theme = theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill =\"#f8faf7\", color=\"#f8faf7\")))\n# logistic regression\nlogit_model &lt;- glm(diab ~ glucose + bmi_fg, data = diab_data, family = 'binomial')\nsummary(logit_model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = diab ~ glucose + bmi_fg, family = \"binomial\", data = diab_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.

Many people, including myself, find odds ratios difficult to grasp and often conflate them with probabilities.\nTherefore lets look at marginal effects, which offer a more accessible way to interpret our results. They show how changes in our predictors affect the probability (not odds!) of the outcome. First thing we could do, is to get individual risk differences: predict the probability of diabetes for a given subject based on their given glucose level, and the probability for one unit higher (+1), and calculate the difference between the two. Analogously for the binary variable, predict the probability of diabetes for each subject, once treating the subject to be overweight (BMI ≥ 25), and once below the threshold (BMI &lt; 25), and take the difference thereof. We could do this by hand, but the comparisons() function from the marginaleffects does this for us (which is the analogue function to slopes() for the continuous relationship from above).\n\n\n\n\ncomparisons(logit_model, variable = 'glucose') -&gt; rr.glucose\nprint.me(rr.glucose)\n\n\n Estimate Std.

    "text": "Background\nRobotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) gained much popularity during the last decade. Although the influence of intraoperative fluid management on patients’ outcome has been largely discussed in general, its impact on perioperative complications and length of hospitalization in patients undergoing RALP has not been examined so far. We hypothesized that a more restrictive fluid management might lead to a shortened length of hospitalization and a decreased rate of complications in our patients.\nMethods\nRetrospective analysis of data of 182 patients undergoing RALP at an University Hospital (first series of RALP performed at the center).\nResults\nThe amount of fluid administered was initially normalized for body mass index of the patient and the duration of the operation and additionally corrected for age and the interaction of these variables. The application of crystalloids (multiple linear regression model, estimate = -0.044, p = 0.734) had no effect on the length of hospitalization, whereas a negative effect was found for colloids (estimate = -8.317, p = 0.021). Additionally, a significant interaction term between age and the amount of colloid applied (estimate = 0.129, p = 0.028) was calculated. Evaluation of the influence of intraoperative fluid administration using multiple logistic regression models corrected for body mass index, duration of the surgery and additionally for age revealed a negative effect of crystalloids on the incidence of an anastomotic leak between bladder and urethra (estimate = -23.860, p = 0.017), with a significant interaction term between age and the amount of crystalloids (estimate = 0.396, p = 0.0134). Colloids had no significant effect on this particular complication (estimate = 1.887, p = 0.524). Intraoperative blood loss did not alter the incidence of an anastomotic leak (estimate = 0.001, p = 0.086), nor did it affect the length of hospitalization (estimate = 0.0001, p = 0.351).\nConclusions\nIn accordance to the findings of our study, we suggest that a standardized, more restrictive fluid management might be beneficial in patients undergoing RALP. In older patients this measure would be able to shorten the length of hospitalization and to decrease the incidence of anastomosis leakage as a major complication."

We first examined the determinants of an individual’s response-and-exploration style, which we assessed using five independent novelty response and exploration tasks. Our findings revealed that both previous care by humans and social housing with conspecifics elicited a curious response-and-exploration style (characterized by a positive response to novelty and a high motivation to explore). Second, we investigated how the response-and-exploration style and previous experiences affected an individual’s problem-solving performance in a variety of tasks aimed at assessing physical cognition, including reversal learning, inhibitory control, causal reasoning and tool use. We found curiosity to be the sole predictor of problem-solving performance. However, curiosity is strikingly rare in wild orang-utans, being mainly induced by contact with humans and living in a safe and stimulating physical and social environment. We therefore suggest that curiosity in orang-utans is an artefact of captivity, a potential only expressed under special conditions. The origin of curiosity in our own lineage may have been an important contributor to the rapid rise in the complexity of our ancestors’ material culture."

We established a cohort of pregnancies by identifying deliveries and estimating the date of the last menstrual period. We analysed the drug burden during a 270-day pre-pregnancy period, during pregnancy (overall and by trimester), and during a 270-day postpartum period. Subsequently, we quantified 1) the median number of drug dispensations (total vs. unique drug claims); and 2) the prevalence of exposure to at least one dispensed drug and the number of dispensed drugs (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥5); and 3) the 15 most frequently dispensed drugs were identified during each period, overall and stratified by maternal age.\n\n\n\nAmong 34,584 pregnant women (5.6% of all successful pregnancies in Switzerland), 87.5% claimed at least one drug (not including vitamins, supplements, and vaccines), and 33.3% claimed at least five drugs during pregnancy. During trimester 1 alone, 8.2% of women claimed at least five distinct drugs. The proportion of women who claimed prescribed drugs was lower pre-pregnancy (69.1%) and similar postpartum (85.6%) when compared to during pregnancy (87.5%). The most frequently claimed drugs during pregnancy were meaningfully different during pregnancy than before and after.\n\n\n\nThis study suggests that 8 of 10 women in Switzerland are exposed to prescribed drugs during pregnancy. Most drugs dispensed during pregnancy are comparatively well investigated and are considered safe. However, the high drug burden in this vulnerable patient population underlines the importance of evidence on the benefit-risk profile of individual drugs taken during pregnancy."

Subsequently, we quantified 1) the median number of drug dispensations (total vs. unique drug claims); and 2) the prevalence of exposure to at least one dispensed drug and the number of dispensed drugs (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥5); and 3) the 15 most frequently dispensed drugs were identified during each period, overall and stratified by maternal age.\n\n\n\nAmong 34,584 pregnant women (5.6% of all successful pregnancies in Switzerland), 87.5% claimed at least one drug (not including vitamins, supplements, and vaccines), and 33.3% claimed at least five drugs during pregnancy. During trimester 1 alone, 8.2% of women claimed at least five distinct drugs. The proportion of women who claimed prescribed drugs was lower pre-pregnancy (69.1%) and similar postpartum (85.6%) when compared to during pregnancy (87.5%). The most frequently claimed drugs during pregnancy were meaningfully different during pregnancy than before and after.\n\n\n\nThis study suggests that 8 of 10 women in Switzerland are exposed to prescribed drugs during pregnancy. Most drugs dispensed during pregnancy are comparatively well investigated and are considered safe. However, the high drug burden in this vulnerable patient population underlines the importance of evidence on the benefit-risk profile of individual drugs taken during pregnancy."

Nicola gave a very hands-on workshop on building R packages covering the most important steps to build one from scratch, including writing functions, documenting them, adding tests, and sharing the package with others.\nFind the workshop slides here and a summary of the most important commands from the {usethis} and {devtools} package right below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Most Important Commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild package\n\nusethis::create_package(\"package_name\")\n\nedit DESCRIPTION file\n\ne.g. Title: title corresponds to a very short description of your package\ne.g. define a licence: usethis::use_mit_license() -&gt; automatically updates your DESCRIPTION file\n\nInstall package\n\ndevtools::install() or press Install in the “Build”-tab on top right (only appears in R-package project). So far the commands built the R package and installed and loaded it.\n\nAdd functions\n\nadd a new R script and add your function\nuse devtools::load_all() -&gt; simulates installation, much quicker than installing the package -&gt; use load_all() while developing your R package\ngood-to-know:\n\nunfortunately one cannot use subfolders within the /R folder to organize functions, but one can have multiple functions in one script\nif a certain function is not available after running devtools::install(), the function has probably not been exported yet. It is recommended to use devtools::load_all() while developing a package.\n\n\nWrite documentation\n\nUse {roxygen2} package\n\nhelps to write the NAMESPACE file\nadd #' @export on top of function in your function script\n\nuse devtools::document() &gt; updates NAMESPACE\n\n\ndifferent roxygen tags\n\n#' @export: makes function available to users of the package\n#' @param: describes function argument\n#' @returns: explains what the function returns\n#' @examples: shows examples how to use the function\n\nrerun devtools::document() &gt; it will add an .Rd file in your /man folder\n\nrerun devtools::load_all() &gt; check with ?my_function to see whether the help file was updated!\n\n\nTests\n\nR CMD check: do functions run? Are they documented? &gt; run check in the Build-Tab\nLinting checks: is the code well formatted?\nUnit tests: do functions work as they should?\nCRAN checks: does it work across different systems? Does it not break any other packages?\nIn the workshop we only covered R CMD check. It is highly recommended to fix the warnings and errors.\nexample error: missing namespacing of package &gt; use usethis::use_package(\"stringr\") which will add in DESCRIPTION File.

Davide Garolini and colleagues developed a proof of concept Shiny app that uses a local (e.g., Ollama) or API-based LLM that helps users see and understand how clinical tables are generated in R. By feeding in an R template (examples from the {Cardinal} package), the app provides step-by-step code explanations and checks for performance, maintenance, and documentation of the code. It’s a great example of how LLMs can support and clarify R workflows in clinical programming. Related packages are {gtsummary}, {cardinal}, and {cards} (see also R/ Medicine 2025)."

    "text": "In many analytical projects, I encounter situations where I need to summarize and present results — such as descriptive statistics or time trends — for hundreds of medications or other health services. In such cases, producing static reports that span hundreds of pages with tables and figures is neither efficient nor user-friendly. Interactive dashboards offer a powerful alternative. They allow stakeholders to explore results dynamically, focus on specific areas of interest, and gain insights much more intuitively than through static tables or figures. However, a major challenge arises when these results need to be shared with external collaborators.\nWhile the R Shiny framework is a very cool tool for building interactive web applications in R, it requires a running R server (or RStudio Connect), which may either not be part of the existing infrastructure or be inaccessible to external collaborators. In such cases, a server-independent, self-contained interactive dashboard becomes an ideal solution.

    "text": "Interactive Analytics Without a Server: {flexdashboard} and Friends\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n{flexdashboard}\nThe first piece of the puzzle is {flexdashboard}, a handy framework in R for building dashboards. What’s great about {flexdashboard} is that the dashboard is a simple R markdown file and the result is just a plain HTML — no server required. You can still include Shiny components if you want (like an interactive plot), but you don’t have to. Instead, you can use {htmlwidgets}, which makes the whole setup fully interactive and completely server-independent. The package enables customizable layouts using R markdown syntax, allowing you to organize content into rows and columns easily, add navigation menus, tabs, and various themes to enhance the user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n{htmlwidgets}\nSo what are htmlwidgets? They’re basically a collection of R packages that allow interactive web visualizations, in other words R-friendly wrappers for popular JavaScript visualization libraries. You can easily drop them into Shiny apps or R markdown reports, such as one built with {flexdashboard}. Some popular widgets are {plotly} (for interactive charts), {DT} (for sortable and filterable tables), and {Leaflet} (for creating dynamic maps). The {htmlwidgets} package itself allows you to create your own widgets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n{crosstalk}\nThen there’s {crosstalk}, a really useful add-on for the mentioned htmlwidgets. It lets multiple widgets talk to each other — so when you filter or select something in one widget, others update automatically. To make this work, the underlying data needs be wrapped in a SharedData object, and as long as the widgets are crosstalk-compatible (see full list here), they’ll stay connected and respond to each other. The package contains various filter widgets (like dropdowns, sliders, checkboxes) that you can easily add to your dashboard to control the displayed data. The biggest limitation is that {crosstalk} only works with pre-calculated data (filters and links of views that display individual rows of data), so you can’t do complex computations on the fly like in Shiny."
